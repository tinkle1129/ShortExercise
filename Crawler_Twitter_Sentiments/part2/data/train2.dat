Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Part of system designed to protect US allies is wheeled into place Parts of a US-built anti-missile system designed to mitigate the threat of North Korean missiles have been moved to the planned deployment site in South Korea as tensions with the nuclear-armed country escalate. Trucks hauling components of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system rolled into the site in North Gyeongsang province, according to a statement from the South Korean Defense Ministry on Wednesday. "Both South Korea and the United States have been working to secure the operational capacity of the THAAD system in preparation for North Korea's advanced nuclear-missile threat," the statement said. "Therefore, this measure was to secure operational capacity by placing some parts of the available THAAD system at the deployment site." "We have expressed serious concern to the US and South Korean sides," Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said Wednesday. "The US-South Korean deployment of THAAD in South Korea will harm strategic balance in the region and further stimulate tensions on the Korean Peninsula. "China strongly urges the US and South Korea to stop actions that would raise regional tensions as well as harm China's strategic and security interests by canceling the THAAD deployment and withdrawing relevant equipment." He added that China will "firmly take necessary measures to safeguard its own interests." In Seongju county, at the location of the THAAD site, around 4,000 police were present to ensure the equipment's delivery. Around 400 protesters were present at a demonstration near the site, and police in riot gear held back protesters as the equipment rolled past on military trucks. Hwang Soo-young, an activist with the government watchdog group, the People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy (PSPD), was at the site of the protest Wednesday morning. She claimed that the protests turned violent as "police were pushing residents away." She claimed six people were injured during the encounter, although CNN has not been able to independently verify the claim. She said that vehicles with equipment "including radar, launchers and generators" started passing the village of Soseongri at around 4.45 a.m. (3.45 p.m. Tuesday ET). Local complaints center around the lack of consultation over the decision to deploy the missile system near their homes. The voices of local people were "never heard, they never asked these people," she said. The goal is to have the complete system fully operational by the end of this year but the US and South Korea have publicly stressed the need to speed up the deployment of the technology as tensions have mounted with Pyongyang. , while the US began joint naval drills in the region with South Korea and Japan and the USS Michigan, one of the most powerful submarines in the American arsenal, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and other officials outlining the threat for the entire Senate. Kim Jong Un guides live fire drills in Wonsan, North Korea, on April 25, to mark the 85th anniversary of the the founding of the Korean People's Army. THAAD is designed to shoot down incoming short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles that threaten civilian populations, just the type of weapons North Korea claims it has. Each THAAD system is composed of five major components: interceptors, launchers, a radar, a fire control unit and support equipment, according to Lockheed Martin, the security and aerospace company that serves as the prime contractor for the equipment. "Deploying THAAD is a critical measure to defend the ROK (Republic of Korea) people and Alliance forces against North Korean missile threats, as highlighted by the recent ballistic missile launches by North Korea," a statement from the office of the US Secretary of Defense said Tuesday. "North Korea's unlawful weapons programs represent a clear, grave threat to US national security in the United States, the ROK and Japan." .m-infographic--1468405138775{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2016/07/13/THAAD_infographic_medium.jpg) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 440px; width: 780px; } The announcement to deploy THAAD has also faced opposition from many residents of Seongju county, near the deployment site, and criticism of the decision to deploy it -- against the backdrop of the increased militarization of the Korean Peninsula -- was a key part of protests that helped bring down former President Park Geun-hye. "The decision made by the government to deploy THAAD was not democratic at all," said Baek Ga-yoon, coordinator for the Center for Peace and Disarmament, which advocates for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. She accused acting-President Hwang Kyo-ahn of taking advantage of the political instability around Park's impeachment to press ahead with THAAD's deployment "without any agreement from the National Assembly and the villagers of Seongju." The upcoming election is expected to result in a swing to the left, likely in favor of the Democratic United Party's Moon Jae-in, who narrowly lost to Park in 2012 and has led opinion polls since her ouster. Moon's party has been critical of the THAAD agreement and suggested it should be renegotiated, saying Park should have sought the approval of the National Assembly before deployment began. "Presidential candidate Moon Jae-in has consistently stated that the deployment of THAAD should be decided by the next government through taking into account sufficient public consultation, consensus and consideration of our national interests and the ROK-US alliance," a statement released by Moon's spokesman, Park Kwang-on, read. "It is better to discontinue the deployment of the equipments and pass the final decision to the next government after going through public and national consensus and consultation between ROK-US."

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. The firm says the hackers were likely gathering intelligence, not trying to disrupt a system A cybersecurity firm in the United States believes state-sponsored Chinese hackers were trying to infiltrate an organization with connections to a US-built missile system in South Korea that Beijing firmly opposes. "China uses cyber espionage pretty regularly when Chinese interests are at stake to better understand facts on the ground," John Hultquist, the director of cyber espionage analysis at FireEye, told CNN's News Stream. "We have evidence that they targeted at least one party that has been associated with the missile placements." A spokesperson with South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN there was an attempted cyber attack last month on their systems originating from China, but would not comment when asked if THAAD was targeted. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN the Chinese government opposes any form of cyber attack, and fights against all form of hacker activity. "This position is consistent, clear, and serious," it said in a statement. The statement reiterated China's opposition to THAAD and called on the US and South Korea to halt its deployment. On Wednesday, the top US commander in the Pacific said the defense system would be operational in days. When asked if the group could be North Koreans posing as Chinese hackers, Hultquist said his team has gathered plenty of evidence to prove the group's origins, including their use of the Chinese language. "We've known these actors for several years now and we've watched their activities." The spying on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was likely done for intelligence purposes, not to disrupt it, Hultquist said. "If it were done in retaliation we'd expect some sort of follow on disruption or destruction of it, which we didn't see. Typically, when we see cyber espionage actors, they prefer to stay quiet and remain on target where they can gather as much intelligence as possible," Hultquist said. .m-infographic--1468405138775{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2016/07/13/THAAD_infographic_medium.jpg) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 440px; width: 780px; } THAAD is a missile defense system the US is deploying in South Korea in case of an attack by North Korea.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. THAAD missile system aims to be counter to North Korean military threats The US anti-missile system designed to mitigate the threat of North Korea's missiles will soon be operational, US and South Korean defense officials said. US Pacific Command chief Adm. Harry Harris told the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday that the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system would be "operational in the coming days to be able to better defend South Korea against the growing North Korea threat." Parts of the system have already been moved to the planned deployment site, The North Korea rhetoric is angry -- but is conflict closer? THAAD was deployed to South Korea by the US in response to North Korea's increased missile and nuclear tests, but the defense system drawn sharp opposition from China and Russia, who see it as also potentially neutralizing their nuclear deterrents. The original goal was to have the complete system fully operational by the end of this year, but the US and South Korea have publicly stressed the need to speed up the deployment of the technology as tensions have mounted with Pyongyang. "Currently, the basic goal is to promote the full operational capability of one turret by the end of this year," South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-kyun said at a briefing. He said that equipment, including launchers, combat control stations and radar, had been deployed to the site in North Gyeongsang province and would be imminently operational. "These things are now in place, so you can connect them to get the operational capability from early on -- that's what 'within days' means." He added that the current deployment was not a "pilot operation" for the full rollout of the missile system, but is "capable of actual reaction to North Korea's provocation." South Korean presidential candidate Moon Jae-in, who is expected to win the country's election on May 9, has called for take economic steps to try to stop South Korea from receiving a defensive system , which the US insists does not pose a threat to Beijing. He added that China appears to be working to deter North Korea, as President Donald Trump has pushed his Chinese counterpart to do. "I'm reasonably optimistic now that China is having an influence, and they are working in the right direction with regards to North Korea thanks to the efforts of our president and theirs," Harris said. The Pacific commander said that he was taking Kim Jong Un at his word that the North Korean leader is determined to develop a long-range nuclear missile that could strike the US and that should "provide us all a sense of urgency" to ensure US forces in the Pacific are prepared. He said providing "credible combat power" was the best way to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. "We want to bring Kim Jong Un to his senses, not to his knees," Harris said. The Pacific commander cited the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group deployment to northeast Asia as such a deterrent against North Korea's rising threats, saying it was now in the Philippine Sea and "in strike range and power projection range of North Korea if called upon to do that." The Vinson is headed north after initial confusion earlier this month about the location of the carrier, a miscommunication Harris accepted responsibility for. "That's my fault on the confusion, and I'll take the hit for it," Harris told the panel. He said it was his decision "to pull the Carl Vinson out of Singapore, truncate the exercise it was going to do south of Singapore, cancel its port visit to Australia and then proceed north." He added, "Where I failed was to communicate that adequately to the press and the media. So that is all on me." Harris did not address what, if any, communications took place with the White House. As another deterrent, Harris pointed to the USS Michigan -- a guided-missile submarine -- that arrived in South Korea Tuesday, saying it was an important show of force. At the same time, Harris talked up his command's unfulfilled needs. He said he only had 50% of the submarines he sought for the region -- "We need more submarines," he said bluntly -- and that he saw a need for more interceptors deployed in California and Alaska to defend against potential North Korean missiles. .m-infographic--1468405138775{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2016/07/13/THAAD_infographic_medium.jpg) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 440px; width: 780px; } He also said he'd be interested in deploying missile-defense radars to Hawaii -- and possibly missile interceptors -- to help better defend the islands from North Korea's missiles. Harris' testimony comes ahead of two congressional briefings on North Korea Wednesday afternoon, where Defense Secretary James Mattis, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats will brief the full House and Senate. Senators are headed to the White House for the briefing, where President Donald Trump may drop in. While the briefings are being held in a classified setting, House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry of Texas said Harris' testimony was important for reassuring the public. "I think the public is nervous, and they need to know that we have the military capability to prevail should a conflict come," Thornberry said ahead of the hearing. Harris is testifying in three congressional hearings this week, but he's doing so without Gen. Vincent Brooks, the head of US Forces Korea, who was supposed to testify but remained in the Pacific due to the increased tensions. Ready to trade up?

The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) is designed to shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles, just the type of weapons North Korea claims it has. Each THAAD system is comprised of five major components: interceptors, launchers, a radar, a fire control unit and support equipment, according to Lockheed Martin, the security and aerospace company that serves as the prime contractor for the equipment. The radar first detects an incoming missile. Those manning the system identify the threat. Then, a launcher mounted to a truck fires a projectile, which Lockheed Martin calls an "interceptor," at the ballistic missile in the hopes of destroying it using kinetic energy -- basically just its sheer speed. .m-infographic--1468405138775{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2016/07/13/THAAD_infographic_medium.jpg) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 440px; width: 780px; } Because it has no warheads on its missiles, instead destroying other projectiles by colliding with them, THAAD is "potentially safer, especially for dealing with nuclear missiles," said Yvonne Chiu, an expert on military policy and diplomacy at Hong Kong University. "If you hit a nuclear ballistic missile with a missile with no warhead, it would hopefully not cause a nuclear explosion." in July that it would deploy the system in the country's south in order to protect it from a a potential attack. .m-infographic--1468389020021{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2016/07/13/seongju_medium.jpg) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 440px; width: 780px; } Unlike North Korea's mostly untested ballistic missiles program, THAAD has been in use for several years by the U.S. military to protect units in places such as Guam and Hawaii from potential attack. "North Korea continues to develop their nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, and it is the responsibility of our Alliance to maintain a strong defense against those threats," Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti, Combined Forces Command, U.S. Forces Korea commander said last month. "THAAD can add an important capability in a layered and effective missile defense." .m-infographic--1468405443153{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2016/07/13/nk_missile_ranges_medium.jpg) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 440px; width: 780px; } While the U.S. maintains that any deployment of THAAD in South Korea would be solely to protect its forces there and their South Korean allies, some see it as further militarization of the peninsula and an escalation of the American presence there. China especially, tends to view any increase in U.S. military presence in Asia as an attempt to contain it and reduce the effectiveness of its weapons. Speaking at an event hosted by the Center for International and Strategic Studies think tank in February, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the deployment of the anti-missile system could jeopardize "China's legitimate national security interests." Anti-war activists hold placards during a rally against THAAD in 2016. "THAAD has a range that could hit weapons in China," said HKU's Chiu. While she added that the significance of THAAD deployment in Korea would be more geopolitical than military, Chiu said that China was understandably concerned "about having a U.S. made, U.S. run missile system in its backyard." "THAAD Is a purely defensive weapon, it is purely capable of shooting down a ballistic missile it intercepts and it is there for the protection of the United States," Secretary of State John Kerry said last month during a visit to Beijing. .m-infographic--1468405810149{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2016/07/13/North_Korea_missiles_medium.png) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 440px; width: 780px; } "Russia and China have obviously expressed concerns about THAAD," he said.

North Korea test-fired four ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan The Patriot and Aegis systems are already deployed in the Pacific region. THAAD, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, can shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in the latter stages of their flight as they plunge toward their targets. But its presence in South Korea might be just as important for its sophisticated radar -- the AN/TPY-2 X-Band radar -- which could provide the first warning of any missile launched from North Korea. The missiles that North Korea fired Monday were thought to be of longer range, designed for targets beyond South Korea. That would put THAAD interceptors out of range. But by being closer to North Korea, THAAD's radar could provide critical early tracking data to missile interception systems farther afield, such as those protecting Japan or US bases in Guam, according to data from the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency. Those other protection systems, including the Aegis and Patriot missile defense systems, are linked to THAAD by the US military's Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications system, known as C2BMC, according to contractor Lockheed Martin. .m-infographic--1488816258923{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2017/03/06/North_Korea_missile_range_desktop.png) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 832px; width: 1100px; } The THAAD battery's radar in South Korea would have detected the launch of the North Korean missiles launched on Monday. Determining the missiles were not targeting South Korea, the THAAD battery would send radar tracking data to US Navy warships equipped with the Aegis missile defense system sailing between South Korea and Japan.

If Aegis interceptors were unable to make the intercept, data from both the Aegis radar and the THAAD radar could be transmitted via the C2BMC system to Patriot missile batteries, which are stationed closer to the enemy's intended targets and would attempt to take out missiles as they are plunging toward those targets, according to the Missile Defense Agency. .m-infographic--1486988778195{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2017/02/13/International_ballistic_missiles_01.png) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 501px; width: 780px; } Though Aegis is touted as being able to track more than 100 targets at one time, and , according to the US Navy, it has never taken out a ballistic missile in combat.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. The US says they're deploying the missile system in case of a North Korean attack Russia and China believe its being used to strategically contain them With missiles at their borders and neighbors aligning with an adversary, China and Russia could feel boxed in. But they're in it together, and the two appear to be taking steps together against US global hegemony. The countries released a joint statement this week voicing their opposition to US and South Korean plans to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system, according to both Russian and Chinese state media. They also plan to take countermeasures, but what exactly they consist of was not specified, "We think the US-South Korean decision to deploy the THAAD missile defense system has seriously threatened China's security interest. For the region, it will also break the strategic balance. So it's completely understandable to see countries in the region firmly oppose this decision," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Friday. "China and other countries have to address our own legitimate security concerns and take necessary measures to safeguard our security interest." The announcement comes as the country's National Security Office Chief, Kim Kwan-jin, met with incoming US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. According to Korean government representatives, the two reaffirmed that THAAD's deployment will be moving ahead as planned. The missile system is designed to take out incoming projectiles -- and has been cited as a way to potentially stop a North Korean nuclear attack. But Russia and China worry that the system is capable of much more than that and is a threat too close to their borders. They believe THAAD will be used to track missiles from either China or Russia, and its placement in South Korea is an attempt to geopolitically contain the two countries. "It's natural and logical for China and Russia to take a joint position," says Victor Gao, director of the China National Association of International Studies, citing that THAAD's range. .m-infographic--1468405138775{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2016/07/13/THAAD_infographic_medium.jpg) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 440px; width: 780px; } Many in the Chinese foreign policy establishment believe that THAAD is a problem on the level of North Korea's nuclear missile program, according to professor John Delury of Yonsei University. "They see the United States trying to build this architecture of containment," he said. President-elect Donald Trump and the US are likely audiences for the statement, analysts say. Russia and China's joint statement drives a wedge in some of the foreign policy views Trump has explicated -- specifically, that Russia could be a stabilizing partner and that China needs to be contained, according to Delury. The statement also comes as his incoming Cabinet nominees are testifying on Capitol Hill, and airing "It's a good time for them (China and Russia) to make this statement -- the US is in transition and everyone is really unsure on what the stance of the Trump administration," says Yvonne Chiu of Hong Kong University. The joint opposition to the system has drawn Russia and China closer militarily, as both countries worry that it'll box them in. The difference stems from the way the system is viewed, according to Delury. "Americans only talk about it in a tactical sense, it's a useful tool alongside a bunch of others to deter North Korea or stop a missile mid-flight", he says. "The Chinese look at THAAD in strategic terms, and what they see is THAAD as part of a bigger picture of a missile defense network along its perimeter." last year, Russia now is looking at the prospect of facing US missile systems near both its eastern and western borders. "Deployment of US missile defense systems in South Korea clearly goes beyond the tasks of deterring 'the North Korean threat,'" Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov said in October, "We do not have any doubts that US, with support of their allies, will continue to build up the potential of the Asia Pacific segment of their global missile system, which will inevitably lead to disruption of established strategic balances both in the Asia Pacific and beyond." The Americans have a tendency to accuse both countries of exaggerating these claims, but both countries worry that the US is trying to surround the two countries with allies. "China has a pretty good relationship with South Korea, and China doesn't want South Korea falling like a domino into a US-led bloc, and let's be honest, there are Americans who argue that's what needed," Delury says. Late last year, the US changed its missile defense policy for the first time in 17 years, according to Daniel Wasserbly of Jane's Defense Weekly. was an amendment to the 1999 National Missile Defense Act. It "robust" defenses against complex threats rather defenses against a "limited" threat. It's a change that's likely welcome among American policy hawks, to help defend the US and its allies from an unstable North Korea, an increasingly aggressive China when it comes to territorial disputes and Russia meddling in its neighbors affairs and internal politics (not to mention the US presidential race.) But from Russia and China's perspective, the change -- combined with the proliferation of missile defense systems on their borders -- could be seen as proof that the US has the two countries in its cross hairs.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. The first pieces of a US-built missile defense system designed to mitigate the threat of North Korean missiles arrived at the Osan Air Base in South Korea Monday night, according to the US military. The announcement comes just a day after North Korea test-fired four ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. China has voiced opposition to the proposed placement of the military hardware known as the , which it sees as a threat to its own security. "We will firmly take necessary measures to preserve our own security interest, and the US and South Korea must bear the potential consequences," Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. With North Korea upping the amount of missile and nuclear tests last year, the US and South Korea have publicly stressed the need to speed up the deployment of the technology. It's designed to shoot down incoming missiles that threaten civilian populations, akin to shooting a bullet with another bullet in simple terms, experts say. .m-infographic--1468405138775{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2016/07/13/THAAD_infographic_medium.jpg) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 440px; width: 780px; } "Continued provocative actions by North Korea, to include yesterday's launch of multiple missiles, only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy THAAD to South Korea," Adm. Harry Harris, commander, US Pacific Command, said in a news release. The decision to deploy THAAD in South Korea was made in July of last year, and US President Donald Trump's administration has said it's committed to following through. US Secretary of Defense James Mattis and South Korean Defense Secretary Han Min-koo spoke over the phone last week and agreed that THAAD should be deployed "ASAP." .m-infographic--1486988778195{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2017/02/13/International_ballistic_missiles_01.png) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 501px; width: 780px; } China has long opposed the deployment of the defense system so close to its own borders and has called on the US and South Korea to stop the deployment. One concern is that THAAD's advanced radar system could be used to spy on China's activities, rather than monitor incoming missiles from North Korea, China also worries THAAD would undermine its ability to respond to an attack on its own soil, says Tokola, a former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Seoul. with the government to provide a site for the THAAD launch systems in late February. In a fiercely-worded commentary published by China's official news agency, Xinhua, said the Lotte board would "hurt the Chinese people" and the "consequences could be severe" if it went ahead. "Lotte stands to lose Chinese customers and the Chinese market. That would be a very large slice out of their business pie," said the commentary, which did not carry a byline. The South Korean government said last week it believed Chinese authorities had told travel agencies in Beijing to stop selling trips to South Korea, The Chinese government, however, denied any knowledge of such an order. If Beijing did choose to retaliate through trade, it could make significant dent. China is South Korea's largest trading partner, with the latter exporting up to $142 billion each year to the country. Almost half of the 17 million people who visited South Korea last year were Chinese, according to data from the Korea Tourism Organization. South Korea itself is split on its support for THAAD. The military wants it, the residents who will live nearby the system don't and opposition parties say it should be debated and voted on within parliament once the current political uncertainty is resolved. South Korean President Park Geun-hye is on trial after being impeached for her involvement in a corruption scandal. "Under the circumstances, such a critical decision should be handled by the incoming government which will have full legitimacy and authorization," says Song Young-gil from the Democratic Party of Korea. .m-infographic--1488816258923{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2017/03/06/North_Korea_missile_range_desktop.png) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 832px; width: 1100px; } The system isn't a panacea that would completely shield the US and its allies from the North Korean missile threat. It's "aimed solely at defending South Korea against missiles from North Korea," according to US Forces in Korea. The system could be overwhelmed if North Korea were to launch a series of missiles simultaneously and it's not effective against submarine-launched ballistic missiles launched from south, east or west of lower South Korea, according to a report from the North Korea monitoring group 38 North RELATED: Are North Korea's missile tests a practice run for evading THAAD? THAAD can detect and track targets within a range of about 1,000 kilometers, the report said, which means it may not stop a potential intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in January that his country is in the final stages of developing an ICBM, which could reach the west coast of the United States. But President Trump vowed that "it won't happen" in a tweet CNN's Paula Hancocks reported from Seoul, and Joshua Berlinger reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. US, South Korea can now deploy the THAAD system to their preferred site South Korea's controversial THAAD missile defense system is one step closer to reality after Lotte International approved a land swap deal with the government Monday, an official with the country's defense ministry said. The THAAD, or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, system is designed to shoot down short, medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, such as those North Korea claims to own. The deal between international conglomerate Lotte and the South Korean government will allow the THAAD system to be deployed on the military's preferred site. The contract will officially be signed on Tuesday, the official told CNN. The US and the South Korean governments are planning to deploy the system by the end of 2017. During his recent trip to South Korea, US Secretary of Defense James Mattis said his country was determined to defend South Korea against But speaking at a news conference Monday, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said it would "severely disrupt regional strategic balance."

A controversial US missile defense system is up and running in South Korea, a week before the country's Presidential election is expected to bring in a government critical of its deployment. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system "is operational and has the ability to intercept North Korean missiles and defend the Republic of Korea," a spokesman for US Forces Korea said in a statement. THAAD was deployed to South Korea by the US in response to North Korea's increased missile and nuclear tests, but the defense system has drawn sharp opposition from China and Russia, whose territory is within the system's range. The system may have been deployed, but according to a US defense official, its operation is "limited." Nevertheless, the official said the system is capable of shooting down a North Korean missile, adding that the US hopes to install additional units to increase coverage over South Korea. The anti-missile system is not expected to be fully operational until the end of the year, but US and South Korean officials publicly stressed the need to speed up the deployment of the technology as tensions mounted with Pyongyang. South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-kyun said at a briefing last week that equipment, including launchers, combat control stations and radar, had been deployed to the site in North Gyeongsang province and would be imminently operational. "These things are now in place, so you can connect them to get the operational capability from early on -- that's what 'within days' means," he said. Moon Jae-in, the frontrunner in South Korea's Presidential election which takes place on May 9, has expressed skepticism over THAAD. Throughout his campaign he's called for its deployment to be decided by the next government. Speaking to South Korean radio station BBS FM on Tuesday, Moon said the deployment was "not a done deal yet," and should be based on public consultation and a vote in the country's National Assembly. Moon's Democratic Party is currently 20 points clear of its nearest rival, according to the most recent Gallup Korea daily opinion poll. Around 40% of voters surveyed said they favored Moon, compared with 24% for centrist candidate Ahn Cheol-soo. THAAD is designed to shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in the latter stages of their flight as they plunge toward their targets. While this means it cannot act against the type of intermediate-range missiles North Korea has been testing in recent months, THAAD also includes a sophisticated radar that will fit into an overlapping series of US missile defense systems, including Aegis warships operating in the Pacific and Patriot missile batteries deployed to Japan. The radar could provide critical early tracking data to these missile interception systems, as well as those protecting Guam, the closest US territory to North Korea.

President Trump, protecting South Korea is not a real estate deal (opinion) - CNN.com if (navigator.appVersion.indexOf('Windows Phone OS 7') > -1 || navigator.appVersion.indexOf('WP7') > -1) {var $html = document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0];Modernizr.load({test: Modernizr.fontface,complete: function () {'use strict';$html.className = $html.className.replace(/\bfontface\b/, 'no-fontface');}});} President Trump, protecting South Korea is not a real estate deal Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. John Kirby: Asking South Korea to pay for an anti-missile system that is deployed by the United States and protects US assets makes absolutely no sense The anti-missile system's geostrategic purpose in South Korea far outweighs any cost of putting it there, he writes CNN National Security Analyst John Kirby is a retired rear admiral in the US Navy who served as a spokesman for both the State and Defense departments in the Obama administration. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. In President Donald Trump's book "The Art of the Deal," he writes about how important it is to know one's market, to study hard. He wrote that he likes to gather as many disparate opinions and views about a potential real estate deal as he can before making any final decisions about how it will affect a given area or neighborhood. So it was a bit surprising to hear him say in an interview Thursday night that he expects South Korea to reimburse the United States for the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system we will soon be deploying to Seongju, a system that Trump said costs about a billion dollars. Seems to me that he hadn't done all his homework. I mean, the United States has already agreed to fund it. But more broadly, he apparently doesn't understand the contours of our alliance with South Korea or the importance of allies themselves. You see, allies are friends. And friends are folks you count on -- and who count on you. At least that's the way it is supposed to work. In this particular alliance -- one of the most important in the world -- the stakes could not be higher. President Trump said so himself in an with Reuters. As if we needed another reminder, Pyongyang fired off yet another missile just today. And yet, here he was in that same interview -- and oh, by the way, virtually on the eve of an important national election in South Korea -- utterly and completely surprising his ally with an announcement on THAAD reimbursement. I'm betting many in his own national security team were taken aback as well. And while I'm sure the far left in Korea, which is opposed to the THAAD deployment, found the Trump invoice a helpful little talking point to support their thesis that the United States cannot be trusted, the President also unnerved millions of mainstream South Koreans who fear that the United States is willing to cozy up to China, divvying up the Asia-Pacific region at the expense -- and without the say-so -- of the Republic of Korea. Even the top foreign policy adviser to presidential frontrunner Moon Jae-in called the payback an "impossible option." And Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, Trump's remarks could actually run counter to the President's stated desire to show real muscle in his approach. "Trump's remarks ... will likely boost support for Moon, and if he wins, it will make it harder for the United States to sustain a hardline policy against North Korea. " It's a strange way, indeed, to treat a friend who is staring down the barrel of a gun while hosting nearly 30,000 American troops on its soil. And that brings up another thing Trump doesn't appear to understand: his own military. The THAAD deployment is just that, a deployment. And like every other military deployment, while we may need the use of certain domestic facilities and physical sites, it's still our stuff and using it is still our responsibility. In this case, THAAD was about one thing and one thing only: shoring up the alliance's defensive capability on the peninsula in the wake of repeated provocations by the North. President Obama said as much at the time of the agreement: "We've worked together to strengthen our alliance, and to ensure our readiness against any threat. Our missile defense cooperation -- THAAD -- is a purely defensive system to deter and defend against North Korean threats." The United States accomplishes that with this system. The South Koreans accomplish it by giving us a place from which to operate it. That was the arrangement, and it's totally in keeping with the Status of Forces Agreement we signed with the Republic of Korea back in 1967. It's not clear at all where the President got his $1 billion figure. That's about what the system costs us to buy, but operating costs are much lower. And since we aren't selling it to anyone, it doesn't make much sense to slap a price tag on it. Plus there's the little matter of scarcity: there are fewer than 10 operational THAAD systems in the American arsenal. Commanders will tell you they need each and every one of them -- and more. Wherever you decide to deploy a system like THAAD, you are by default making a decision about somewhere else you won't be able to deploy one. It's a zero-sum game for such a precious commodity. So while it makes perfect sense to put one in South Korea right now, we aren't exactly out hawking them out to all bidders. THAAD is a complicated, technologically advanced system designed to shoot missiles out of the sky. And it belongs to the United States. We own it. We maintain it. We deploy it. Hopefully, we will never have to use it. And make no mistake, THAAD is just as much -- if not more -- about protecting our own assets, resources and troops on the Korean peninsula as it is about helping protect those of our ROK allies. For the commander in chief to hold it out as some sort of insurance policy on which we wish to extract a premium is to ignore completely the role this system plays in protecting American lives as well. Finally, I don't think the President fully understands the art of this particular deal. This deal is most decidedly not a zero-sum game. Everybody wins. Our troops and their families are safer. Our South Korean allies are safer. Pyongyang's ability to hit the South with missiles is reduced. China gets the message loud and clear that we mean business about our interests on the peninsula. And our allies and partners -- there and around the world -- take comfort in the fact that the United States will continue to meet its security commitments. President Trump's team should be commended for the thoughtful, deliberate and strategic approach they have taken to the problem of North Korea's provocations. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was downright sober and succinct Friday at the United Nations, laying out in clear language how seriously the United States is taking the issue and how unafraid we are to lead the rest of the world in solving it, if need be. In that vein, there is a powerful and important geostrategic purpose to the THAAD deployment, one that far outweighs any cost of putting it there. And the President does a disservice to his national security team -- not to mention our alliance -- when he speaks about something as miserly and mean as reimbursement. This isn't some real estate deal. It's a nation-state deal, a national security deal. And in deals like this, trust -- not cash -- is the coin of the realm. Unfortunately, Mr. Trump just spent a fortune of that. Ready to trade up? Find out how much your home is worth Getting ready to sell?

Seoul (CNN)The first pieces of a US-built missile defense system designed to mitigate the threat of North Korean missiles arrived at the Osan Air Base in South Korea Monday night, according to the US military. The announcement comes just a day after North Korea test-fired four ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. China has voiced opposition to the proposed placement of the military hardware known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, which it sees as a threat to its own security. "We will firmly take necessary measures to preserve our own security interest, and the US and South Korea must bear the potential consequences," Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday.

THAAD, the missile defense system kicking off a new US-China fight, explained - Vox THAAD, the missile defense system kicking off a new US-China fight, explained A South Korean television broadcast reports on the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) on July 13, 2016, in Seoul, South Korea. The United States military has announced that the THAAD anti-ballistic missile defense system in South Korea — designed to intercept incoming missiles from North Korea — is now officially operational. “U.S. Forces Korea confirms the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is operational and has the ability to intercept North Korean missiles and defend the Republic of the Korea,” said Col. Rob Manning, US Forces Korea spokesperson in a statement. And while the North Koreans are certainly not thrilled about that, they’re far from the only ones upset about THAAD. China adamantly opposes the deployment of THAAD, seeing the system as a threat to its military capabilities. "China calls for an immediate stop to the THAAD deployment on the Korean Peninsula," China's foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang "China will pursue protecting its interests going forward by taking the necessary measures in a stern manner," said Shuang. The missile system is also facing criticism from some South Koreans worried about Chinese economic retaliation as well as some environmental and safety concerns. And now that South Korea’s pro-THAAD president has been impeached, THAAD’s future could be in jeopardy. Here, then, is a quick guide to what THAAD does, and why so many people are so upset over it. So what is THAAD, exactly, and why is China so mad about it? THAAD stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. It’s designed to detect and then intercept incoming ballistic missiles in their “terminal” phase — that is, when they’re on the way down, not on the way up. , and it’s now being deployed in South Korea to protect against any incoming missiles from the North. According to data from the , which conducts regular tests of US ballistic missile defense systems, the THAAD system has had 13 successful intercepts out of 13 attempts stretching back to 2006. The THAAD system uses sophisticated radar to detect incoming missiles. In order to detect incoming missiles from North Korea, THAAD’s radar system needs to be pointed at — you guessed it — North Korea. But it just so happens that when you point this sophisticated radar system at North Korea, you don’t just see North Korea — you also see parts of China. China and North Korea do share a border, after all, and That means China is worried that THAAD’s radar system could potentially help the US better detect missiles being launched at the United States in the event of a future war. To the US military, of course, the ability to detect a Chinese nuke heading our way even earlier than we currently can sounds pretty great. But for the Chinese military, this means the US now has a slight edge. The Chinese military can’t put radar anywhere near that close to the US to detect incoming US nukes, which means that in a nuclear conflict, the US would have a slight strategic advantage — it would be able to detect an incoming Chinese nuke and respond faster than China could in the reverse. Getting super worked up about another country potentially having a very slight strategic advantage over you in some hypothetical future war might seem a tad ridiculous to regular folks like you and me — and especially to those who didn’t live through the darkest days of the Cold War, when such matters felt much more real and immediate — but these sorts of things are taken very seriously by militaries, and China is no exception. “I want to emphasize again that China is firm in its resolve to oppose the deployment of THAAD in the ROK [Republic of Korea] and will resolutely take necessary actions to safeguard its own security interests,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Shuang at a press briefing in Beijing in late February. “Any consequences entailed from that will be borne by the US and the ROK. We strongly urge relevant parties to stop the deployment process and not to go further down that wrong path,” he said. Protesters attend the rally to denounce deploying the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in front of the Defense Ministry on July 13, 2016, in Seoul, South Korea. The specter of Chinese economic retaliation against South Korea is one of the main reasons why some in South Korea oppose THAAD. And indeed, China has already begun to impose some of those “consequences” on South Korea — or, more specifically, on one of South Korea’s biggest companies. The company in question is the Lotte Group, a multinational conglomerate headquartered in Seoul. Last week, it agreed to give up a parcel of land it owned to the South Korean government to use as a base for the THAAD system. Then, all of a sudden, at least 23 Lotte Mart stores across China were by Chinese authorities. As CNN reports, Chinese officials claim they were shut down over violations of fire safety regulations, but the timing is a bit suspicious, to say the least. from streaming in China — one of their biggest and most lucrative markets — Chinese internet users have But fear of economic retaliation isn’t the only reason some South Koreans oppose THAAD. There are also safety and environmental concerns among local residents in the area where THAAD is being deployed. shaved their heads in a mass demonstration against the government’s decision to house THAAD in the southeastern county of Seongju, a region famed for its melon farming. Activists said they were concerned that the system's sophisticated radar could harm their crops and that having a missile system nearby would potentially make the area a target in wartime. , the governor of Seongju stood in front of a crowd of 5,000 protesters and wrote “No to the deployment of THAAD in Seongju” that some critics in South Korea are also upset with the government’s choice of Seongju as the THAAD site because putting it there will mean that the country’s capital, Seoul, will be outside the coverage of THAAD’s intercept missiles. And now that South Korea’s President Park Geun-hye, who was a staunch supporter of THAAD, has been , THAAD’s future could be in some jeopardy. Snap elections to replace Park are scheduled for May 9 — just a few days from now — and the leading candidate, Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party, has for halting the deployment of THAAD “until the new president takes office and can evaluate its benefits and drawbacks.” “The delivery should be halted even how, and the next administration should ultimately decide this issue,” Moon Jae-in’s campaign manager “The next administration, however, will continue to face an excruciating dilemma,” writes South Korea expert Benjamin Lee in . “If South Korea decides to revoke the THAAD decision, this will set a terrible precedent, which will cause China to believe that it can use its economic influence over South Korea to control Seoul’s strategic agenda.” For now, at least, THAAD’s deployment to South Korea looks like a done deal.

U.S. Army soldiers from the Alpha Battery, 2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment launch the first of two Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptors from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands 10 September 2013 during a successful intercept test. The test was conducted by the Missile Defense Agency, Ballistic Missile Defense System Operational Test Agency, Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated Missile Defense, and U.S. Pacific Command. The test, designated Flight Test Operational-01, stressed the ability of the THAAD weapon systems to function as part of a layered defense architecture to defeat two near-simultaneous ballistic missile targets. (Photo courtesy of Missile Defense Agency) In the spring of 2013, the U.S. government faced a provocation cycle from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), which, for the first time, involved a direct and viable threat to the U.S. territory of Guam. In response to these threats, the military deployed the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to the island. THAAD is the Army’s newest and most advanced missile defense system, and has proven itself to be an effective deterrent to North Korean aggression. Since its first operational deployment, many important lessons have been learned that military leaders should use to plan for future deployments of the THAAD system. The DPRK has executed repeated provocation cycles over the decades that have caused various types of military responses. Historically, these provocations focused on conventional military actions against their rival, the Republic of Korea. However, since his December 2011 assumption of leadership, DPRK ruler Kim Jong-un has used his country’s growing arsenal of ballistic missiles as his preferred choice for provocation cycles. During the eighteen-year rule of his father, Kim Jong Il, there were eighteen missile tests. In comparison, during Kim Jong Un’s four-year reign there have been twenty-five missile tests. Though most of the U.S. homeland is out of range of North Korea’s current ballistic missile inventory, the U.S. territory of Guam is located approximately two thousand miles from the DPRK. Possibly believing they had identified a potential U.S. vulnerability, DPRK military officials made repeated threats against Guam as part of their spring 2013 provocation cycle. The distance between Guam and the DPRK puts the island’s 161,000 U.S. citizens within the range of the DPRK’s ballistic missiles. The threats of a North Korean missile attack were taken very seriously on Guam as air raid and shelter-in-place drills were conducted on the island. Furthermore, Guam’s governor, Eddie Calvo, appealed directly to then Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to deploy missile defenses to defend the island. In response, the U.S. military initially deployed an Aegis ship equipped with SM-3 missiles to defend Guam. However, due to the persistent North Korean ballistic missile threat to the island, a sustainable long-term alternative was needed. Fortunately for Pentagon planners, the THAAD system had just received a conditional material release for two batteries and a transition of operations to the Army in February 2012. Subsequently, in March 2013, a decision was made by the National Command Authority to deploy a THAAD battery to Guam to protect the homeland of the United States from an immediate and emergent threat of a missile attack from North Korea. In early April 2013, the secretary of defense directed the Army to deploy the A/4 Air Defense Artillery THAAD battery out of Fort Bliss, Texas, to Guam. The A/4 THAAD battery was placed under the command of the 94th Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC), headquartered in Hawaii. The A/4 THAAD battery assumed the Defense of Guam mission on an expeditionary basis on 25 April 2013. The deployment had special historic significance since the soldiers were the first active-duty air defenders to deploy to Guam since World War II. Since this first operational deployment of THAAD, the Army has fielded a total of five batteries, with four already rotated to conduct the defense of Guam mission. The fifth THAAD battery became a permanently stationed unit on Guam in 2016. In the next two years, two additional THAAD batteries will bring the fielded total to seven. These additional batteries have provided military planners the capacity to support deployments to areas in need of the system’s unique capabilities. Additionally, it has been announced that South Korea was designated as the next location for a forward-stationed THAAD battery. Notwithstanding the deployment of these batteries, as other adversaries continue to advance their ballistic missile capabilities the demand for THAAD will only increase. This demand means military planners need to learn the special requirements to deploy a THAAD battery now, rather than waiting until a decision to deploy is made. A study of the first operational deployment of THAAD to Guam is the best place to begin learning these planning requirements. The most salient lessons learned are noted below. First, the command and control infrastructure for the unit needs to be developed before any decision is made to deploy a THAAD battery. The first part of developing command and control is building the organizational command structure. For the THAAD battery on Guam, a headquarters element called Task Force Talon was established. The task force was composed of personnel from the 94th AAMDC in Hawaii. The Task Force Talon staff was composed of six noncommissioned officers, five staff officers, a sergeant major, and a lieutenant colonel who commands the unit. Most of the personnel conduct one-year temporary change of station tours to Guam from Hawaii. The task force headquarters executes all the functions expected of a battalion staff such as processing personnel actions, providing intelligence support, planning operations and coordinating logistics. The headquarters staff also serves as the organization that integrates THAAD operations with the Air Force’s 36th Wing on Andersen Air Force Base and with Joint Region Marianas, which has executive-level installation management responsibilities on Guam. Integration of the battery with the 36th Wing and Joint Region Marianas has been extremely important because those organizations provide the majority of the logistical support for the task force such as with lodging, dining facility support, medical services, and bulk fuel. All this support required the signing of various Inter-Service Support Agreements that were developed by the Task Force Talon headquarters. The task force headquarters also conducted coordination with outside organizations such as the Missile Defense Agency and Army Aviation and Missile Command that provide external support to the THAAD battery.

Vincent Brooks speaks with soldiers of the A4 THAAD (Theater High Altitude Area Defense) 18 August 2013 about numerous personnel and operational issues during his visit to the unit at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam.

(Photo by Angela Kershner, U.S. Army Pacific PAO) Another somewhat unusual, but important, function of the Task Force Talon staff that needs to be considered in THAAD battery deployment planning is support arrangements for distinguished visitors to the site. The high-profile mission of Task Force Talon has made it a key location for senior leaders to visit. Past visitors have included the governor of Guam, congressional delegations, news media, senior Department of Defense leaders and foreign dignitaries. Without support from the Task Force Talon staff, the captain that commands the THAAD battery and his headquarters platoon personnel would have to execute all the protocol missions associated with distinguished visitors, a function for which they lack the experience and personnel to properly conduct. Most importantly, diverting assets for protocol purposes with higher headquarters’ support would take away from the battery’s main focus, which is executing its real world Defense of Guam mission. This is why it is imperative that as soon as the intent to deploy a THAAD battery is confirmed, that the higher headquarters be identified as well. In the case of Task Force Talon, the 94th AAMDC personnel directorate (G-1) immediately requested a derivative unit identification code to establish a higher headquarters on Guam. It is important to execute this request as soon as possible since the process takes time to complete. For example, Task Force Talon was on the ground on Guam and operating before the task force was officially recognized with a derivative unit identification code because of the rapid deployment of the THAAD battery. The Task Force Talon commander did not officially assume command until the derivative unit identification code was received. The next part of command and control involves developing an adequate communications architecture to support THAAD battery operations. It is critical for THAAD battery operators to be able to communicate with the greater missile defense network established in the Indo–Asia–Pacific region to coordinate fires properly. Being located on an existing Air Force base allowed terrestrial communications lines for external communications connectivity to be run to the THAAD battery’s location. However, for such an important real-world mission the THAAD battery required a redundant communications capability. The deployment of a Secure Mobile Anti-Jam Reliable Tactical Terminal (SMART-T) system and its accompanying squad of soldiers from the 307th Signal Battalion out of Hawaii, provided this redundancy for Site Armadillo. The SMART-T is a Humvee-mounted extremely high frequency satellite terminal that provides robust, jam-resistant communications in support of the THAAD battery. Considering the increasing cyber and electronic warfare threats to military communications, the SMART-T is a critical capability that ensures the THAAD battery is always able to communicate with the greater missile defense network in the Indo–Asia–Pacific region. For future deployments of THAAD, military planners will need to determine provisions for redundant and secure communications for the THAAD battery. When THAAD was designated to deploy to Guam one of the most obvious issues military planners had to determine was where to put the THAAD battery. The proper placement of a THAAD battery is critical to ensuring it is located in a position that provides the highest probability of intercepting enemy tactical ballistic missiles. For Guam, the enemy tactical ballistic missile threat to the island was coming from the northwest where the DPRK is located. Fortunately, northwest Guam was largely unoccupied since it is home to an abandoned airfield. The airfield, known as Northwest Field, was constructed after the military recaptured Guam from the occupying Imperial Japanese military in July 1944. Now, seventy-two years later, the historic runways of Northwest Field have become the perfect location for deploying a THAAD battery. The most complex piece of equipment to plan site requirements around is the THAAD battery’s AN/TPY-2 radar. The radar is considered the world’s most powerful ground-mobile X-band radar. The radar antenna is also what gives the THAAD location on Guam its name “Site Armadillo.” When the AN/TPY-2 radar antenna is in a stowed configuration, it looks like the hard surface of an armadillo’s shell. This powerful radar requires a very firm surface for transport and emplacement. The low ground clearance and sensitive equipment inside the radar requires that a solid road be used during transport. This means that a thorough reconnaissance of the roads identified for transport needs to be completed prior to the deployment. The perfect THAAD site is of no use if the radar cannot be safely transported to the location due to poor road conditions. Once at its final destination, the THAAD radar needs to be emplaced on a firm surface in order to acquire objects hundreds of miles above the Earth’s surface. For example, the radar would not be able to accurately track these objects if it was sitting on a soft surface and slowly sinking into the mud. The seven-decade-old runway tarmac on Northwest Field proved to be a suitable surface to emplace the THAAD radar. Besides planning for a firm surface, an additional consideration is that safe keep-out zones for personnel and aircraft need to be maintained around the radar. The powerful radiation from the AN/TPY-2 radar could have negative effects on people’s health and could damage aircraft if safe keep-out zones are not enforced. The Army Techniques Publication 3-01.91, lists the features of safe keep-out zones. These zones range from one hundred meters for troops up to 5,500 meters for aircraft carrying munitions. In keeping with this guide, due to the flight operations of nearby Andersen Air Force Base and Guam’s Won Pat International Airport, a temporary flight restriction was established around Northwest Field along with other safety measures to ensure no aircraft flew within the radar’s safe keep-out zone. Additionally, the THAAD launcher also was given a back blast safety keep-out zone that was a three-hundred-meter semicircle around the rear of the launcher and eight hundred meters in front of it. For the THAAD battery on Guam, Hesco barriers and razor wire were constructed to enforce the safe keep-out zones for personnel and equipment. Maintaining and enforcing such keep-out zones will be a critical planning requirement for any future THAAD deployments. Besides being a safety consideration, the powerful X-band radar along with other emitters from the THAAD battery require frequency clearance. Without proper frequency clearance and management, a THAAD battery has the possibility of interfering with the operation of other civilian and government frequencies used in the area. Due to THAAD operating in a remote area of Guam, frequency clearance was able to be properly coordinated with few issues. However, future deployments of THAAD could require it to emplace in or around more urbanized areas. The more urbanized a THAAD operating location is, the more challenging the frequency clearance process will be. The brains of the THAAD radar is the THAAD Fire Control and Communications (TFCC). The unit’s soldiers operate the TFCC from shelters, which are located in four specialized light medium tactical vehicles. The TFCC, THAAD radar, and launchers all require appropriate grounding. Proper grounding of the equipment ended up being an issue initially for THAAD on Guam because of the coral rock directly below the surface. The coral rock was difficult to penetrate with grounding rods and did not provide the recommended grounding for the equipment. The installation of a grounding grid for the TFCC and the THAAD radar and the construction of launcher pads with appropriate grounding within the concrete resolved these issues on Site Armadillo. Future THAAD sites will need to conduct surveys of the site’s soil to determine if it meets the recommended grounding requirements for THAAD equipment. The first elements of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system arrive in the Republic of Korea (ROK) 6 March 2017. U.S. Forces Korea continues its progress in fulfilling the ROK–U.S. Alliance decision to install the THAAD system on the Korean Peninsula as a defensive measure in response to ongoing provocative North Korean missile tests. (Photo courtesy of 7th Air Force PAO) A final site consideration is determining the need for a long-term power source. The THAAD battery was originally designed to conduct short-term deployments in support of the warfighter and then redeploy back to its home station. However, for THAAD on Guam, the mission became an enduring one due to the persistent missile threat from North Korea. One result was that the tactical generators on Site Armadillo had to run twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. This heavy usage meant extra maintenance had to be conducted to keep the generators operational. The maintenance became challenging because the THAAD battery was assigned only one generator mechanic. Also, the maintenance challenges only increased when additional generators were needed to power the site security cameras, communications equipment, and life support trailers. To reduce the generator maintenance burden, Task Force Talon was able to acquire a Mobile Electric Power 810A generator to power Site Armadillo from a single power source. This prime power source allowed all the tactical generators on the site to be powered down and serviced after two years of near continuous use. It also had the side benefit of improving the quality of life on Site Armadillo due to the decrease in generator noise. However, relying on tactical generators should not be regarded as a permanent solution. As part of the planning process for future THAAD deployments, a plan for long-term power generation to sustain a THAAD site will need to be developed. Depending on tactical generators for long-term operations is not a sustainable course of action. Prime power generators or, if available, commercial power are options that should be explored for the long term power needs of future THAAD sites. Due to the remote nature of Site Armadillo and the availability of the abandoned runways, the site considerations were easily resolved for the deployment of THAAD to Guam. However, somethings that would prove to be far more challenging were the environmental considerations. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires that all branches of the government give proper consideration to the environment prior to undertaking any major federal action. Since Guam is a U.S. territory, the Defense Department had to comply with the NEPA guidelines as part of any THAAD permanent stationing action on Guam. This required the Defense Department to conduct an environmental assessment (EA) to document the environmental impacts associated with the operation of a permanently stationed THAAD battery on Guam. The EA is an extremely detailed document that looks at air quality, noise pollution, water resources, biological resources, cultural resources, hazardous materials, socioeconomic impacts, and a host of other factors that are part of any stationing action. If the EA determines that the permanent stationing of THAAD will not have significant environmental impacts, a finding of no significant impact will be issued. A finding of no significant impact is a document that presents the reasons why the EA concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts for the project. Along with complying with NEPA requirements, THAAD on Guam had to comply with local environmental regulations. For example, the previously mentioned installation of a grounding grid required a well-drilling permit from the Guam Environmental Protection Agency. The THAAD radar has grounding rods for the radar that are nine feet long (in three three-foot sections) and one-half inch in diameter. Due to the coral rock below the surface, a drill was required to install the grounding rods. In order to drill the grounding rods into the ground, the local vendor had to secure a well-drilling permit from the Guam Environmental Protection Agency that cost the task force thousands of dollars to purchase. Another environmental consideration is the impact on-site noise will have on local communities. The THAAD radar is powered by two powerful prime power units that can generate noise in excess of the eight-five decibel level, which can cause hearing damage with prolonged exposure. Fortunately, the isolation of Site Armadillo prevented any noise issues with the local community. However, at a forward-based radar site that uses the AN/TPY-2 in Kyoga-Misaki, Japan noise pollution has been a serious point of contention between the Army and the local community. The issue was contentious enough that Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani made a visit to the U.S. base at Kyoga-Misaki in December 2015 as part of a public relations campaign to show the local community that all efforts are being made to reduce noise. The installation of muffling devices and sound barriers eliminated most of the low frequency noise on Kyoga-Misaki. These measures together with future announced plans to hook up the site to commercial power to fully eliminate noise pollution has done much to allay community concerns. For future THAAD sites, military planners need to determine if the noise from the prime power units will have an adverse impact on local communities and develop ways to reduce it, like at Kyoga-Misaki. Though most of the environmental considerations mentioned resulted from compliance with NEPA due to the location being on U.S. soil and under its jurisdiction, future THAAD deployments will likely be to areas external to the United States, which would fall outside the jurisdiction of the NEPA. However, planners will still be required to identify any potential environmental regulations that will need to be complied with before a THAAD deployment. Likewise, a campaign to educate the public about THAAD will also be needed. For example, due to negative media coverage about the possible environmental impacts of THAAD in South Korea, various political figures have come out against the deployment. On Guam, Task Force Talon has been able to avoid such criticism by proactively engaging the public and the island’s political leadership about the deployment of the THAAD system. The task force leadership conducted a series of town halls in local villages to educate and receive feedback from the public about the permanent stationing of THAAD. The task force also participated in major local events, sponsored schools, and hosted site visits for local dignitaries to strengthen bonds between the task force and the local community. These bonds built trust with the local community and the island’s political leadership to support the permanency of THAAD on Guam. After working out if a location can support a THAAD battery, the next thing planners need to consider is how to secure the potential site. Due to the unique nature of THAAD being a strategic asset, for security, it falls under Strategic Command (STRATCOM) Instruction (SI) 538-02 (classified), . Inside SI 538-2 it clearly identifies physical security requirements such as the fencing, lighting, and sensors needed to secure a THAAD site. The original expeditionary deployment of THAAD caused the site to be secured with nonpermanent physical security features such as concertina wire and wooden guard towers. The reason more rugged physical security structures could not be built on Site Armadillo initially was because of the pending environmental assessment. Once the EA is complete, permanent fencing, concrete guard towers, and other physical security enhancements can be constructed. The expeditionary physical security infrastructure became a major concern when Typhoon Dolphin hit Guam in May 2015 and destroyed some of the temporary security infrastructure. Powerful storms are a regular occurrence on Guam, which makes building permanent infrastructure for a long-term presence on the island a priority. For future THAAD sites, military planners will need to complete an assessment to determine what permanent physical security enhancements are required by the STRATCOM Instruction and then develop a course of action to properly secure the site. The STRATCOM Instruction also identifies the amount of personnel needed to secure a THAAD site. Since a THAAD battery does not have enough personnel to conduct its missile defense mission and still comply with the SI 538-2 security requirements, it has to be augmented with a security force (SECFOR). To comply with the SI’s security requirements, U.S. Army Pacific deploys a SECFOR company on a four-to six-month rotation to Guam to defend Site Armadillo. The SECFOR units supporting this task have ranged from military police to artillerymen, engineers, and infantrymen. Future deployments of THAAD will require a SECFOR and the size of the element will depend on the security infrastructure in place around the site. More personnel are needed to secure an expeditionary site compared to a permanent site. Once a SECFOR unit is established, the security personnel will need to be well trained in the escalation of force. In all operations, the starting point for engagement criteria is the standing rules of engagement (SROE) and standing rules for the use of force (SRUF). The definitions for these terms are found in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3121.01B, The SROE from the CJCSI 3121.01B provides the inherent right of self-defense and the application of force for mission accomplishment. The SROE is designed to provide a common template for development and implementation of rules of engagement for the full range of military operations, from peacekeeping to war, when outside the territory of the United States. Within the U.S. territory, the SROE applies only to air and maritime homeland defense missions. Included in the SROE are SRUF, which apply to land-based homeland defense missions within the territory of the United States. This means the SROE apply only to the air defense personnel regarding use of their THAAD weapon system and the SRUF apply to the SECFOR personnel. The distinction between the two caused some initial delays in understanding the SROE for THAAD and the escalation of force authorized for the SECFOR personnel when the unit first deployed to Guam. For future THAAD sites, planners will need to closely work with the legal community and confirm that the correct kill chain for THAAD is written into the deployment order. Additionally, planners will need to develop an internal standard operating procedure that clearly depicts what escalation of force measures are appropriate, how they are used, and when the use of deadly force is authorized for the SECFOR unit. As adversaries continue to build and proliferate their ballistic missile capabilities, the demand for THAAD will only increase. In order to meet the demand, military planners must become familiar with some of the complexities involved with deploying a THAAD battery. Deploying a THAAD battery requires some unique planning considerations when compared to other more common air defense systems such as the Patriot system. The first operational deployment of THAAD to Site Armadillo on Guam provided many important operational lessons to better plan for future THAAD deployments. Not all planning considerations for THAAD can be described in this paper due to security classification reasons, but planning for the command and control, site requirements, environmental considerations, and security for a THAAD site is where planners need to start in order build their own “armadillo.” Choe Sang-hun and Steven Erlanger, “North Korea Threatens U.S. Military Bases in Pacific,” Paula Hancocks, Judy Kwon, and K.

Amerykańska telewizja bazuje na komentarzach krajowych specjalistów od cyberbezpieczeństwa. – Chiny korzystają z cyberszpiegostwa dość regularnie, gdy chińskie interesy wchodzą w grę – powiedział CNN dyrektor ośrodka analiz ds. cyberszpiegostwa FireEye John Hultquist. – Mamy dowody, że (Chińczycy) namierzyli co najmniej jedną z instytucji biorących udział w rozmieszczaniu rakiet – dodaje ekspert. Rzecznik południowokoreańskiego ministerstwa spraw zagranicznych, cytowany przez piątkowy dziennik „Korea Times” powiedział, że w kwietniu zarejestrowano próbę cyberataku, ale nie potwierdził, czy jej celem był system THAAD. Amerykańskie wojska rozpoczęły pod koniec kwietnia br. instalację systemu obrony antyrakietowej THAAD na terenie Korei Południowej. Chiński MSZ protestował i mówił o naruszeniu „strategicznej równowagi w regionie”. W poniedziałek agencja Reutera powołując się na anonimowych przedstawicieli władz USA poinformowała, że system osiągnął „wstępną zdolność operacyjną”. System THAAD (Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense) jest przeznaczony do niszczenia głowic pocisków balistycznych w ostatniej fazie lotu. O zamiarze jego rozmieszczenia na terytorium Korei Południowej poinformowały w lipcu ubiegłego roku władze w Seulu. Jak podkreślał wtedy przedstawiciel resortu obrony, system THAAD zapewni ochronę dwóch trzecich terytorium Korei Południowej przed ewentualnym zagrożeniem nuklearnym i rakietowym z Korei Północnej. Plany instalacji systemu wywołały już wtedy sprzeciw Chin i Rosji, a także Pjongjangu. „Schetyna nie zmienił poglądów – powie wszystko, żeby zdobyć i utrzymać władzę” Jest zgoda Rady UE na przedłużenie kontroli na granicach w strefie Schengen Na pokładzie samolotu do USA bez laptopa?

It will be focused "solely on North Korea" and not any third party nations THAAD is an advanced defense system that can intercept ballistic missiles The U.S. and South Korea have agreed to deploy an advanced military defense system that could intercept North Korean missiles following continued weapons testing by Pyongyang in defiance of U.N. resolutions. , the two governments said they are in the final stages of recommending a location in South Korea for the system, called Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), to be installed. Yoo Jeh-seung, South Korea's Defense Policy Office head said it was a "defensive measure" to "protect alliance military forces from North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile threats." "It will be focused solely on North Korean nuclear and missile threats and would not be directed towards any third party nations," Yoo said at a joint press conference attended by U.S. and South Korean officials. over the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, the latest in a series of U.N. violations. .m-infographic--1452062700443{ background: url(http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/01/06/nk-missile-ranges-large.jpg) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 620px; width: 1100px; } Despite the assurance the weapons system would only be used to counter potential North Korea hostilities, China and Russia objected within hours of the news. "The deployment of THAAD is of no help to realize denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, or the maintenance of peace and stability on the Peninsula," a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. China urged the U.S. and South Korea to halt the deployment process and to "refrain from actions that might damage the interests of China's strategic and security interests." Russia's Foreign Ministry said the move would "negatively impact global strategic stability," according to official news agency Interfax. The report did not elaborate further. As North Korea's closest neighbor, China has repeatedly said it views increased U.S. military presence in the region as an affront to its security. Yvonne Chiu, an expert on military policy and diplomacy at Hong Kong University told CNN in an earlier interview that China was understandably concerned "about having a U.S. made, U.S. run missile system in its backyard" due to the capability of THAAD to reach Chinese territory. Friends, foes, or frenemies: Have North Korea and China patched things up? THAAD can intercept incoming ballistic missiles as it enters what is known as their "terminal" phase (when the missile starts to aim downwards, not just in its upward launch trajectory) at incredible speed and altitude. It's been used for several years by the U.S. military to protect units in places such as Guam and Hawaii from potential attack, and could thwart the short, medium, and intermediate range missiles that North Korea claims it has. .m-infographic--1462503914627{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2016/05/05/North_Korea_missiles_medium.png) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 440px; width: 780px; } The parents in North Korea of an inadvertent defector react to , shared by CNN's Will Ripley, from their daughter, who lives in South Korea and cannot return home.

A North Korea veteran stands against the backdrop of the USS Pueblo, a US Navy ship that North Korea captured in 1968. CNN's Will Ripley‪ asked this veteran about his thoughts on the USS Carl Vinson, an American aircraft carrier conducting joint drills with two Japanese destroyers in the western Pacific Ocean. The veteran told Ripley, "We can sink that aircraft carrier." Ripley noted that in Pyongyang, children are often seen dressed in bright, colorful clothing, contrasting with the more conservative and darker outfits worn by many adults. as the nation marks the birth of its founder, Kim Il Sung, who is also the grandfather of current leader Kim Jong Un. North Koreans celebrate the birthday of Kim Il Sung. He would have been 105. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appears at a ceremony to formally open a housing development in Pyongyang on April 13. The project was rushed to completion in under a year, North Korean officials say. North Koreans gather to witness the opening of the Ryomyong Street housing development. Foreign journalists are filmed by North Korean media during the Ryomyong Street event. North Koreans observe a statue of their founder, Kim Il Sung, at the Museum of the Korean Revolution on April 10.

North Korean soldiers march below statues of North Korea's founding president Kim Il Sung and his son, Kim Jong Il. Weapons are paraded through Pyongyang as a clear signal to the rest of the world that North Korea has military might. A large mural of North Korean founder Kim Il Sung stands outside the Jang Chon cooperative farm, a 30-minute drive outside the capital Pyongyang. Farm manager Kim Myong Jon is something of a celebrity in North Korea. During the past 40 years, she's met with all three North Korean leaders. The farm where Kim Myong Jon works is home to one of North Korea's first greenhouses. It was first visited by Kim Il Sung more than three decades ago, and more recently by his grandson, current leader Kim Jong Un. Chili peppers lie in the sun at the Jang Chon farm. Peppers are used for making kimchi, the fermented cabbage dish that is a staple of the North Korean diet. CNN's Will Ripley speaks with scientists from North Korea's space agency, the National Aeronautical Development Association (NADA). In September 2015, CNN was given exclusive access to the newly opened satellite control center. The futuristic space center is in a residential area not far from the center of Pyongyang. Two officials walk in the grounds of the space facility. NADA officials told CNN that they had prepared multiple satellites and were in the "final stages of perfecting all operations." was called on stage to show how it's done."I managed to get three going, much to the delight of the crowd," he said. In May 2015, CNN was given rare access to a faculty apartment in an upscale area of Pyongyang, near Kim Il Sung University. The lounge was neat, if a little dated. This is the master bedroom of the three-bedroom apartment. A university professor lives in the home with his adult children. It's 200 square meters (about 2,150 square feet). That's large for an apartment in Pyongyang. Books are neatly lined up above a desk in the study. There's a lamp for reading and a large padded chair.

Young boys practice a drum routine that they will perform during International Children's Day. Junior Lt. Col. Nam Dong Ho speaks to CNN correspondent Will Ripley. In May 2015, Ripley and his team were granted rare access to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in North Korea. An estimated three-quarters of North Korea's standing army of more than a million is based near the heavily fortified border. Soldiers stand guard on the North Korean side of the DMZ.

Twin statues honor the late leaders of North Korea, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. Visitors to Pyongyang are routinely taken to pay their respects and lay flowers at the monument. Kim Jong Un personally inspected the plans for this new water park and had his top officials test the water slides for safety. The Pyongyang Gold Lane, a bowling alley in the North Korean capital, is popular among young people. Pyongyang Airport is the first stop on tours of North Korea. Air Koryo is the national airline. It operates direct flights from Beijing and Shenyang in China, and Vladivostok in Russia. Air Koryo has an aging fleet, although it has purchased some newer aircraft in recent years. The inflight magazine features multiple pages on Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. The inflight meal consists of a burger and a glass of North Korean beer. The formal decision to deploy THAAD comes two days after the U.S. placed sanctions personally on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and 10 other officials for alleged human rights abuses. That is in addition to heavy sanctions against the government for nuclear and missile activity. The U.S. State Department said it hopes that the naming of specific individuals will dissuade mid- and lower-tier officials from committing abuses out of fear of being blacklisted. North Korea lambasted the decision, calling it an "open declaration of war against DPRK" and "the worst crime that can never be pardoned," according to the country's state news agency KCNA.

An exclusive report putting perspective on the week's most important developments. missiles and road-mobile launchers to a designated site in central South Korea overnight. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang condemned THAAD deployment during a regular press briefing and said the move "destroys the regional strategic balance and further prompts tensions on the Korean peninsula," South Korean television network SBS reported. THAAD undermines the national security interests of China, the spokesman said. "Cancel the deployment of THAAD. Otherwise China will decisively take necessary measures," Geng said. China's state-owned television network CCTV aired footage of South Korean protesters at the THAAD site, highlighting how the deployment is an unpopular measure among the activists. The media also focused on progressive South Korean presidential candidate Moon Jae-in and his criticisms of the deployment, which presumably took place overnight to attract the least amount of attention from the public. The ultimatum from China comes at a time when state-owned carrier Air China has resumed selling flights to Air China had announced it was no longer operating a route between Beijing and Pyongyang on April 14, but travel has resumed with two flights a week, from May 5 through Oct. 27. Chinese authorities also banned the import of 83 South Korean cosmetic and skin care products, South Korean news service News 1 reported. The ban affects about 18 percent of all cosmetics of South Korean origin, according to the report. A South Korean cosmetics industry representative told News 1 the ban appears to be intentional and linked to the THAAD decision.

It's for protection not projection of power. It wouldn't even be effective against Chinese ICBMs. I took a class on war taught by someone who wrote their doctoral thesis on nuclear weapons, and he said when it comes to nuclear weapons, offensive and defensive weapons are weirdly flipped. Because of nearly every world power having a nuclear arsenal, there's no way to actually use nuclear weapons offensively, because you're guaranteed to be wiped out yourself (MAD, etc etc). The enormous cost to using nukes means that their only real purpose is to defend against other people's nukes. Missile shields throw a wrench into the works. If you can deploy a hypothetical missile shield that can block 100% of incoming missiles, you can launch your nukes at your rivals without any consequences. Suddenly, everyone that was protected from you by That's the basic reasoning behind why deploying missile defense systems can be viewed as a prelude to attack, instead of just a self-defense measure. Yup, this. We also have to take into account China's policy of minimum deterrence. They only have as many nukes as they need (and really dedicating time/money/logistics to building and maintaining new ones would put a lot of unneeded stress on them and their military). If a THAAD system pops up next door, then that might mean that they need to add to their stockpile or arrange them differently. That being said, the U.S. and South Korea are just doing it because North Korea is pants-on-head retarded and won't stop instigating shit. The US gave China the option of reigning in NK long before this happened. It declined so here we are. China only has itself to blame. I've read that this has not only to do with China's business connections with NK, but as well as the fact that if NK imploded, China would face a migration crisis worse than the current one in Europe/Middle East. I don't remember where I read this though, but I feel like it makes a lot of sense. The last thing China needs is more people, no? Which is why they could have prevented this with financial pressure. Except THAAD has no value against ICBMs and no missile shield is 100% perfect. There have been lots of studies on this but missile defense is such a hard problem due to things like decoys and chaff even getting to 30% would be a monumental achievement. In case you weren't being fatuous and were genuinely curious, no, South Korea doesn't have nuclear weapons. Instead, it has the United States' nuclear arsenal at its back, along with 30,000 U.S. troops stationed around the country, meaning that if Korea were ever targeted by a nuclear strike, the U.S. would retaliate in kind. So why would siting THAAD in South Korea, which has no nuclear weapons of its own, or in its territory, impact on MAD between China and the USA? Edit: As some people seem to have a blind spot when it comes to a sense of proportion, let me colour in some facts for you. The operational range of the THAAD system is quoted as "Maximum intercept range is 200 km (125 miles) for a target at 150 km (93 miles) altitude." No part of South Korea is within 200km of China or Russia, indeed it is almost exactly the distance from Seoul to Pyongyang (195km). Missiles fired from either China or Russia would never need to pass over the operational window of a THAAD system sited in South Korea to strike the mainland USA. I don't know the technical capabilities of the THAAD system, but if it covers a wide enough range it could feasibly knock out Chinese-launched ICBMs. That's not a bad thing, right? But from China's perspective, it means China is susceptible to a first strike while being denied the ability to retaliate, thereby nullifying the basic principles of MAD. If you read the article, you'll see that THADD doesn't have the capabilities to protect against ICBMS at all or even mid-range ballistic missiles. I'm not a military expert but, once again, if you read the article you'll find out that the THADD deployed in South Korea is only directionally effective. In this case that would mean it's pointed North at North Korea not west, or southwest at China. THAAD was developed after the very poor showing of the Patriot missile system (which was designed to shoot down planes) against Iraqi Scuds. It's to defend against relatively low tech short range ballistic missiles. Same as if China deploys their version of THAAD in Cuba The thing is, THADD isn't an end all defense system. It's capabilities are limited and any regional power has the ability to overwhelm it via a large scale attack. China is looking at it this way: Korea is helping the US to undermine the MAD. It's never about the intercepter missiles, but always about the x-band radar with 2000 km range in the first place. Then why isn't China boycotting American products too? Why the Chinese pick on South Korea? If this is an American conspiracy to attack China, why aren't the Chinese calling for revenge and boycotting America? Because Korea has the ability to stop it as well, and they are a lot easier to pick on. Well, America is looking at it this way -- they had North Korea on the ropes. China intervened, propped up North Korea for decades, and now has to own the problem. Make sense? North Korea would not exist without China. China has only itself to blame, both for what North Korea is doing, and what US/Korea/Japan do in response. Which means it needs to fuck the fuck off with a quickness. If China wants to escalate, then do it. Otherwise, eat shit and die, CCP. For real. Meanwhile Russia sets up a new radar array facing China and proudly boasts about how it can see even a single fly taking off. But it's toy of daddy Putin, can't complain. Plus it's against North Korea.... I mean who the fuck is against that? I think a fair argument to make is that it's useless provocation. It doesn't protect anyone really. Seoul is within artillery range of NK, and Japan already has its own missile defense. It would be fair then to place the same defensive missile system right up close to USA as well? Of course the USA wouldn't tolerate someone preventing them from having their missiles being effective. Yes, but the US doesn't have some one like PRK as their next door neighbor, so not a lot of justification. The US gave China the option to control NK to avoid this. China declined, so here we are. I'm no weapons expert, but assuming that graphic in the article is an accurate representation of the system... am I the only one that thinks it looks a bit I mean, I'm sure there is some insanely advanced software behind it and it's super revolutionary and all, but I expected something a little more than a truck with a missile launcher attached to it. With all the controversy I expected some super futuristic silos or missile launchers straight out of StarCraft. Well that radar on wheels is close to $1B. And in a typical deployment it's surrounded by 4 missile battery carrying trucks. And yes there's a lot of stuff going on both in hardware and software in order to be able to detect and direct interceptors to knock down incoming targets. Its really all in the detection and guidance systems. These things have to chase down an enemy missile so I expect they go fast as fuck too. I feel like the US probably already has space laser technology for our defense systems. The important thing is where we placed it. It's sort of like, your move NK. Although I think they already made moves shooting off 4 missiles the other day. Yes. China seems to be promoting the idea that, to quote a student of mine, "they can see everything." I am curious the extent to which these undermine Chinese security. I feel like the US probably already has space laser technology for our defense systems. Onion news: Smart, Qualified People Behind The Scenes Keeping America Safe: 'We Don't Exist' A Russian hacker and a Twitter troll walks into a bar. nsa_intern87 said, "that graphic... am I the only one that thinks it looks a bit basic?" It it is my considered opinion that every graphic in that article was drawn by an art design major that flunked math &amp; phyics, found a job as a secretary at CNN, and never understood what everybody was talking about this missile thing whatever it is, and doesn't reallly like work anyway. It's mobility is also one of its strengths, it can be flown around the world and be action ready in 4 hours. But Beijing and Moscow don't see it that way. They're both vehemently opposed to THAAD's deployment because they believe it threatens their own security interests. By threatens their own security they mean they won't be able to lob missiles at South Korea, Japan and the USA unopposed, so they think it's not fair and have decided to angrily stomp their feet like a fat 6 year old that is denied a second ice cream for lunch. At the risk of repetition, wtf has this to do with deployment of this system in south Korea? allow a country to survive nuclear attack. Imagine if China had a similar system and launched nuclear weapons at the US - The US is obviously saying "What the fuck?" and retaliates by sending it's arsenal at China. China uses it's defense system and shoots all but a few nuclear missiles out of the air before they reach the mainland. China wins. No-one is Mutually assured destruction is no longer a thing, the US is a wasteland, Europe are debating whether they will be next and wondering whether to try a first-strike against China but needs a defense system of it's own first. Shit will go downhill very very quickly. THAAD has an operational range of 200km, it can barely reach Pyongyang and is effective against missiles in the terminal phase. How is this an actual threat to China? I'm talking specifically about South Korea, not the use of this system (which was initially developed in the 80's) in the USA. But they have their own radars all over China, looking at S.Korea, Japan, and US territory Guam. They can do whatever they want, but other's can't defend themselves? They are such a cry baby. How will the Chinese nationalism react? Will there be violence against Korean cars/businesses on the streets? something is in the news that is offensive to China or seen as a threat. The government will stoke up nationalistic fires just enough to keep everyone aware that China is the victim of cruel and merciless bullying, you'll get a month or two of annoying WeChat posts about "true chinese will forward this!" telling you to boycott S.Korean stuff, and by the end of the year everyone will be back chomping on Bibimbap and buying makeup and watching the soaps again. It's literally the same every single time. Exactly this. One of my coworkers the other day shared some fiery post about how Chinese people should unite as family and boycott the evil Koreans and everything they make. This lasted exactly as long as it took for her to discover the 1+1 event at innisfree at which point she left work early to make the sale. One of my students told me about this yesterday (I was completely unaware). She told me she would boycott their goods, as apparently some South Korean goaded China saying they would start buying again within a week. When I ask her if she would boycott Japan (where she's travelling next week), America, the Philippines, Taiwan, she had no response. Her brain is probably the size of a small face lotion jar :) Unfortunately she is one of my smarter students. You can imagine the rest. Those kind of Chinese anti-foreign boycotts go back to at least 1905. It never worked but just as with a Lion Dance they do it every year at least once. Yeah thank God America never did this. Now praise the Lord and pass the Freedom Fries, patriot. I remember the anti French riots. Blood everywhere. Some shit just stays with you. Yeah America never did riots did we. White on black, black on white, Protestant on Catholic, white on Chinese...nope never happened. Friction from a changing society is quite different from unnecessary violent riots because of government stoked nationalism. Man talk about splitting hairs. 'Nationalist violence bad! Racist violence...meh, ok.' As her if she'll boycott the Chinese products that use South Korean intermediate goods like semiconductors. No violence yet, though on social media there are calls to boycott South Korean goods - mostly in consumer household electronics and beauty products. Although if the Chinese boycott South Korean cars as well as Japanese cars, I'm not sure where they would buy from. More Euro/U.S. autos perhaps? I just hope they'll boycott Jeju soon. I was stupid not to visit it years ago before all the Chinese descended upon it. Some South Korean analysts today are saying that China will now turn on the heat even hotter now after this. Lotte boycott is just a start, and they will start the destruction of relations with S.Korea and China. They say there's a good chance that China will break off diplomatic relations with South Korea. Some South Korean political analysts say that based on the harsh words coming out of Beijing, that China is threatening war on South Korea and that there are some chance that China will start a military action. Is China crazy enough to face the US in a war over this? Meanwhile, all the Korean residents and tourists in China are scared stiff that they will be targeted. They are all told to stay away from crowds, stay inside, and do not give themselves off as Korean in front of the Chinese. Many are packing up to leave as soon as they can. The businesses there are also suffering with all the Chinese customers boycotting, and now they fear property damages may soon be seen with Chinese government created/backed riots. Many tours to China, from South Korea are getting cancelled, as fearful and angry South Koreans who booked their China tours are canceling their plans. heh, you're not going to fool us, most of us actually LIVE in China. Where are you getting this from? Are you even in China? Had a good time with a few South Korean girls at 五道口 on Saturday. Saw some Korean students at BFSU yesterday. This is all ridiculous tin foil hat shit. You sound like a moron said that due to the scandal with the Shaman, the conservative party is pretty much done, and the left party is willing to suck everybody's dick in name of peace and the economy, so it seems a move by China to make sure the left wins. So does this mean now that any missile in the future launched from north korea will be shot down? For example, THAAD would shoot down every missile launch from NK They won't. Although the purpose is purely provocation they won't go that far. China indirectly created the north Korean problem and they should fixed it instead blaming everyone created North Korea, in the sense North Korea would have been conquered without their intervention into the Korean War. And the US could have not marched all the way to the Chinese border but instead just secure the south as planned Hey, I thought South China Morning Post is a Hong Kong paper? But then I read this Chinese government propaganda crap from them. "China must take a hard line on both North and South Korea" Did you actually read the article? While I think some of the things it proposes may border on propaganda, it mostly takes an unbiased view. Could say some parts even take a more negative view on China. For a country that keeps loudly demanding everyone stay out of their internal affairs, they do a whole lot of whining about what people do in their own countries. Oh well, if China had reigned in their mad dog, THAAD wouldn't have been deployed. And sanctions arrive on Lotte. Such is the way of geopolitics This could be a trigger for end of the world depending on how the players handle it. REDDIT and the ALIEN Logo are registered trademarks of reddit inc.

Indian Top Court to Rule on Muslim Divorce With 3 Words A mock North Korean Scud-B missile, center left, and South Korean missiles are displayed at Korea War Memorial Museum in Seoul, South Korea. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) Gen. James Mattis is in South Korea, and the new defense secretary has delivered what one analyst calls an "unexpected present" from the Trump administration: clarity on US policy. Mattis arrived in the country Thursday on his first foreign trip in his new role; he'll also visit Japan. He restated the firm US defense commitment to South Korea and addressed controversy over the South's planned deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, saying North Korea is the only country that has anything to fear from THAAD, reports. China has expressed concern about the US-developed system. Mattis said the system wouldn't be needed at all if it wasn't for the North's provocative behavior. Since taking office, Trump has been issuing orders that upend "longstanding American policy lines," making Mattis' trip and reaffirmation of US commitment to allies an "unexpected present," Go Myong-hyun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, tells the . And with more Pyongyang missile launches expected soon, the reassurance will be especially welcome in the South. The North has "a wonderful tradition of greeting every new US president with a bit of fireworks, sometimes a nuclear test, sometimes ICBM launch and they're not going to break this tradition," Korean studies professor Andrei Lankov at Seoul's Kookmin University tells CNN. For further reading, check out the on what THAAD is and why it's making Beijing so upset. N.Korea had no fear of Obama. He had Better Fear President Trump.. The tall missile to the right in the photo looks like a Nike. I grew up adjacent to a Nike site, with its radar domes and all looking like giant golf balls on tees during the late 60s and early 70s. The base had a Nike on a trailer, ostensibly for parade and training use. We rode minibikes near the outer rim of the base, and occasionally watched tanks on drills around the base. At least the focus is on a true worldwide gangster who needs his fat little ass slapped around and not longtime allies like Mexico or Australia.

US Begins Deployment Of Controversial THAAD Anti-Missile System To South Korea | Zero Hedge No, the “New” CNN Video of the Chemical Incident Does NOT Prove that the Syrian Government Did It “If There Was A False Flag Nerve Agent Attack, This Tells The Perpetrators That When They Engage In The Murder Of Children They Can Build A Stronger False Case” Report: Trump Mulling Spicer Replacement After Press Secretary Fumbles Comey Announcement For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it. US Begins Deployment Of Controversial THAAD Anti-Missile System To South Korea Well that escalated quickly. Just a day after North Korea's test firing of 4 missiles towards US bases in Japan, and hours after North Korea warned the world was "on the brink of nuclear war" due to US-South Korea "maneuvers," arrived at the Osan Air Base in South Korea Monday night The decision in January to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system, had "We think the US-South Korean decision to deploy the THAAD missile defense system has . For the region, it will also break the strategic balance. So it's completely understandable to see countries in the region firmly oppose this decision," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. "China and other countries have to address our own legitimate security concerns and take necessary measures to safeguard our security interest." "Deployment of US missile defense systems in South Korea clearly goes beyond the tasks of deterring 'the North Korean threat,' Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov said in October, according to Russian state-run Tass news agency. Some equipments including 2 launch pads for U.S. missile defense system known as Thaad arrived in South Korea on Monday and will continue to be brought in, "Continued provocative actions by North Korea, to include yesterday's launch of multiple missiles, only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy THAAD to South Korea," Adm. Harry Harris, commander, US Pacific Command, said in a news release. US Secretary of Defense James Mattis and South Korean Defense Secretary Han Min-koo spoke over the phone last week and agreed that THAAD should be deployed "ASAP." White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer signaled the deployment Monday when he told reporters that the United States is "taking steps to enhance our ability to defend against North Korea's ballistic missiles, such as through the deployment of a THAAD battery to South Korea." U.S. defense officials confirmed to meant delivery was already under way — not that the United States was simply restating its previous promises to send the system to South Korea sometime in the future The US and its allies in the region, notably South Korea and Japan, tend to focus on THAAD's defensive nature. They tout its value as a system to prevent a missile from hitting a target and killing people. "This is purely a defensive measure that the alliance must take in light of the serious threat posed by North Korean missiles," Chris Bush, a spokesman for the US Forces in Korea said. "We do not have any doubts that US, with support of their allies, will continue to build up the potential of the Asia Pacific segment of their global missile system of established strategic balances both in the Asia Pacific and beyond." Interestingly, it's not just Russian and Chinese officials that are against the US deployment of THAAD; "We have to realize clearly that THAAD cannot stop the nuclear missiles coming from the DPRK. How can the 48 missiles of THAAD stop the over 1,000 missiles from the DPRK? The north of Chungcheongbuk-do and the capital area jointly account for more than half of our population and most of our territory. THAAD cannot even cover these areas, but merely increases the regional military tensions. To be honest, deploying THAAD will hurt both us and China. No one will gain anything from it. The starting point of THAAD is wrong, so we have to reconsider it completely. Otherwise, our future will be gloomy, chaotic and insecure." Clearly the rush to get THAAD deployed counters any pre-emptive rejection by Lee. We are sure China's response will be swift at this apparent 'retaliation' by the US. Chinese analysts believe that THAAD in South Korea is intended to intercept missiles launched, not from North Korea, but from China and Russia . THAAD has an operational range of 200 kilometers (km) and is designed to intercept missiles at altitudes between 40 and 180 km. Such altitudes, according to (PLA), match the “terminal phase” of the intermediate, long-range and even intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), or those with ranges exceeding 3,500 km. PLA analysts also claim that they match the “mid-course phase” of medium-range missiles, or those with ranges between 1,000 and 3,500 km, including China’s DF-21 and DF-26 missiles. Because the direct threats to South Korea — including the Seoul area, where 40 percent of the South Korean population resides — are North Korea’s long-range artilleries and short-range ballistic missiles, THAAD, they believe, is clearly a mismatch against such threats. Even though it would be configured as a fire-control radar with a detection range of 600 km, it perhaps could which allows a detection range exceeding 2,000 km. Such a range suggests that China’s missile activities on land and at sea in northern and eastern China may be mostly exposed. The radar allegedly can see the critical processes where warheads and decoys are released during China’s strategic missile tests. In times of war, it can undermine the reliability of China’s strategic deterrent because in comparison with Alaska-based radars, it is believed to be capable of acquiring more than ten minutes of early warning time against China’s strategic ballistic missiles . It can also differentiate real warheads from decoys. If integrated into the U.S. national missile defense network, this radar allegedly can increase the odds of success in intercepting Chinese missiles even at their “boost phase,” reducing further the reliability of China’s already small strategic deterrent and tilting the strategic balance in favor of the United States. Moreover, Chinese analysts believe that the Korean Peninsula has historically been a nearby sphere critical to China’s security. They worry that by deploying THAAD, South Korea could share data with the United States and Japan on air traffic control, air defense, and early warning. This may help to integrate South Korea-based systems with U.S. and Japanese sensors and sea-based Aegis systems, with the goal of to contain China at China’s door steps. Chinese analysts believe that North Korean nuclear tests were only used by the United States to deploy THAAD, the real U.S. intention being to between South Korea and China at a time when China-South Korea relations were improving substantially, as reflected in the countries’ booming bilateral trade and Park Geun-hye’s attendance at the Victory Day Parade in Beijing in September 2015. THAAD deployment would bring the United States and South Korea closer at the expense of China’s security. This could help the United States to stabilize U.S.-South Korea relations and prevent the possible loss of the U.S. military foothold on the Korean Peninsula. Furthermore, Chinese analysts believe that THAAD deployment in South Korea may to compensate for the range deficiencies of its PAC-3 missile defense systems. They also believe that South Korea’s decision would not only harm South Korea-China relations, but also harm South Korea itself by removing its “strategic flexibility” in balancing among major powers and in handling North-South relations. , South Korea has also set a bad example for China’s neighbors to follow if no substantial cost is incurred to South Korea. Finally, Chinese analysts claim that THAAD deployment would not deter North Korea from developing nuclear weapons, but instead may drive it to develop more and better nuclear weapons and missiles Chinese analysts have proposed a wide range of countermeasures to retaliate against the THAAD deployment. in developing strategic offensive weapons, particularly in developing “penetration” technologies that can defeat missile defense. Other proposed countermeasures include concealment and redeployment of China’s strategic capabilities to reduce their exposure to the THAAD radar, and accelerated development of China’s own missile defense systems. Other analysts argue for economic sanctions. Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes. If the Chinese don't like THAAD; they can take out Kim Jong Un. Otherwise, they need to STFU. Kim Jong Un is no threat to US. We are listening to fake news, remember? The same one who told us about Saddam Hussein and WMD. It's all a re-make of a bad movie. Someone wants a yuge war badly. It's unfortunate that hanging thaad had to be deployed just to incent DPRK's neighbors to put a muzzle on Lil Kim. They had plenty of time to deal with Un, but no incentive. So, make a deal, ffs. Offer to remove Kim in exchange for FedExing Thaadie back to the US. I wager Mattis will remove them once Xi or Putin feed Un to the Mad Dog. I'm making over $7k a month working part time. I kept hearing other people tell me how much money they can make online so I decided to look into it. Well, it was all true and has totally changed my life. This is what I do... Government lies - the pictorial labelled " How it works " should read " If it works ". If history is anything to go by I recall that the Chief of CONTROL was named You'd have thunk that the M.I.C. would 'get smarter' than that with acronymns. Maybe the 'SIEGFRIED' or the 'STARKER' / 'SHTARKER' was on the short list? Even better the 'HYMIE', a useless piece of robotic kit, thoughtfully named after his father. I know they cost 10 times more than the Russia models, but do they work as well? Go watch the videos. They most certainly work and that's why that particular system causes an uproar everytime it is mentioned. The X-band RADAR excuse is hogwash too: X-band is already watching everything. There are no secrets any more. These are effective systems. Too expensive, but effective. They are also offense-capable... Offense-capable? Reach out 120 miles to kill things in terminal phase? Not very offensive sounding to me. The iron dome is less than worthless. It can't defeat anything better than the home made "scuds" the Palestinians lob at it. The Palestinians probably get the scuds from Israeli arms dealers. And the USA has yet to demonstrate any functional current gen anti-missile tech to anyone. It doesn't matter: no one will know if they work/not. Cuz, even if it works, this won't get all or even most. There's a lot of overkill. in an all-out strike lotsa' overkill. What about a "rogue launch?" What about a smaller overkill? all parts of the tradeoffs in this high-stakes poker game. Because Russia and China say they are too super duper and unfair. Somehow China building MIRV'd ICBMs during the last 20 years didn't upset the strategic balance, but deploying a defensive system is "destabilizing"? That's fake news right there. Hype and propaganda. They didn't fire "towards US bases in Japan", they just fired in a general eastward direction over the sea of japan. Big difference between truth and propaganda. The US is doing basically the same they are doing to Russia,,, putting missile systems on her western borders claiming to protect EU from an 'Iranian attack'. The US is surrounding Russia and China and readying for a first strike. They might get away with it with China (for now) but not Russia. This also shows it doesn't matter who the President in the US is,,, as the US military, Intelligence gangs and their controlling parties are dancing on dangerous ground risking the lives of billions and possibly most life on Earth. Edit: It is beginning to appear the US military is no longer controlled by the US government per se. Very nice SPIN move to absolve Trump of any cupability.If the President does'nt have any say in his own nation's affairs,Than why do you vote??????? You must work at a job where basic mathmatical skills are'nt needed?Pentagram...err...Pentagon maybe???LOL!!!!! THAAD is abolutely a defensive system. So, really - what the fuck is the fuss all about - SERIOUSLY?!? Nary a missile from THAAD's 48 will be fired off if NO missiles are fired at South Korea. Seems damn simple to me. So I'm sure you would be OK with Russia installing S400s in Canada and Mexico? Continental US is quite a big place, actually. It includes virtually the entire world. Here is a little something from Greece, where the "Homeland Security" guys have been busy taking out a competitor (sorry, I meant evil arms dealer). Athens is in North America, isn't it?. That means I must live just north of Dallas! Who knew? Some have said the US provided NK with some missiles. Now that they've fired a couple of them we see deployment of systems that are a threat to China and Russia. Just like it was planned. Whoever said that is full of BS. The Soviets and the Russians provided the Norks with missiles and/or designs to buid them. Methinks sthe Chinese critics of the THAAD deployment protest too much. Come on, THAAD is primarily a defensive system -- if it works. I've always found it bizarre that enhancing one's defensive capability could be seen as offensive. So, you're mean't to just let your people sit there like sitting ducks when there are systems available to help protect them?? The Chinese don't like it but the problem begins and ends at the doorstep of their "boy" in DPRK. He has escalated the situation with his development of nuclear-armed *long-range* missiles. The Chinese seriously need to remove this guy. He is loose cannon in every sense of the phrase. Not sure that THAAD will reassure many residents of Seoul, though. They're under threat from DPRK's artillery just a very short distance away on the border. THAAD is not really meant tp protect them -- its no good against thousands of artillery shells raining down. THAAD protects Japan, stopping missiles as they over-fly Sth Korea. Even if they don't explode as they get hit and crash down onto Sth Korean soil the nuclear warheads will split open and badly contaminate the crash zones. More than 60 years ago, General MacArthur advised Truman to respond to China's siding with Kim Il Sung -- at a moment when Sung was on the ropes and facing annihilation -- by attacking the Chinese homeland. Truman fired him. Result was the war was stalemated and never ended. By not dealing decisively with North Korea -- and its Chinese allies --way back then we now face a MUCH BIGGER potential disaster. I'd hate to be a resident of South Korea now. Terrible. Woo hoo! My family is honored the MIC has chosen gooks to be the spark that brings nuclear incinceration. Last year we were all very concerned that Syrian camel jockeys were going to be the "Franz Ferdinand." China and Russia would never sell bad weapons now would they...fuck em...Japan should put a ring around their island...Its their right, if it's OK with Chinese and russians Yeah. It's a replay of the E. Eurpean ABM that's supposed to shoot down non-existant Iranian missiles... It's obvious this is all part of a first-strike program... US and allies taking a big step to escalate the chances of nuclear war... very dangerous indeed. For China and Russia it means the best strategic is their own first-strike, sneak attack... you reap what you sow. If you're not firing first, your defense better be spot on. Clearly Mr Trump is not in charge of anything but his Twitter account.

True, but then how would you be able to add snarky comments? And equally telling was that they "replaced" Mark Steyn with him! I gave up on Will decades ago. Found it kind of telling that NRO brought him onboard. POLL- Americans Hit Record Liberal Views On Moral Issues Like Birth Control , Porn And Homosexuality Let's see: this wasn't a killing or even a political killing - it was just a career Washington insider finally being let go with more than sufficient cause. So it wasn't political, except in the sense of public officials doing their job for once, it wasn't "murder" and it certainly wasn't an "axe murder" (really Charles, how lurid!). Maureen Dowd is a reliably nasty libtard c word of a woman who deserves abject contempt and derision. Olbermann Calls On Foreign Intelligence Services to Overthow the U.S. Government. Really. I warned him yesterday or the day before that if he wasn't careful he'd wind up like George Will. Apparently he didn't listen to me. This really does prove that -Q- is right -- NRO is now basically reacting entirely to the liberal media establishment, and thus is no longer functioning as a true conservative publication at all. Olbermann Calls On Foreign Intelligence Services to Overthow the U.S. Government. Really. This is what Republican control of Congress has done for us: they won't repeal Obamacare and they won't repeal Obama's insane "green" regulations. Tell us, guys, why should we vote for any of you in 2018? Maureen Dowd needs to reach out to these people. She suffered terribly from Bush Derangement Syndrome and actually had to seek professional help. She could help these people help themselves. No, they haven't. They're as unchanging over time as the Horseshoe Crab, and about as astute politically. No, don't get me wrong. I do not agree with his position on that point either. But the blog is written honestly. I can understand and appreciate his reasoning - I simply come to a different conclusion than he does. The problem with a lot of these NT scribblers and commenters is not that I disagree with them or they with me - it is that they are dishonest in their reasoning, either willfully or because they are deranged. Well, Al Gore invented the Internet and Obama could bend light. Somethow, I think The Donald is smart enough to NOT believe his own BS. Me too. Good a guy as McCarthy is, his judgment of others is sometimes suspect. He defended the integrity of Patrick Fitzgerald also, the man who wanted Dick Cheney's scalp and when he couldn't get it ran a perjury trap grand jury investigation into a crime he knew never happened (Valerie Plame and her not-so-secret identity). "There was ample bipartisan sentiment for letting Comey go. And there was ample time from Election Day on to do so. " Well, there may have been ample time, but PRESIDENT OBAMA, who was president "from election day on" until January 20, 2017, didn't do that, did he Charles? In fact, Charles, there was ample time from JULY5 ON, for not only Obama to let him go, but for a whole bunch of Congress critters to demand he be fired for suggesting that because his team couldn't find any "intent" (deliberately setting up and using a private server somehow is unintentional?) EVEN AFTER he just got through saying that any reasonable person in Hillary's position, or any reasonable person around her, should have known you don't handle classified info that way, then ludicrously and insanely remarking that any "reasonable" prosecutor wouldn't prosecute. Political axe murder? Who was killed? Well, during the reisgn of the Obama Justice department and the Obama Department of defense and the Obama State Department, the Benghazi Four were killed and nobody was held accountable, and the border patrol agent was killed with guns allowed by all three of those departments to be whisked across the border and no one was held accountable. You want to talk about political, Charles? Did you even read your compadre's book "The Death of Outrage"? When did yours die, Charles? Same time George Will's did? Sad to see Krauthammer spiraling down the same drain-hole that has already claimed French, KDW, Shapiro, and Goldberg. Interesting that Nature has felt compelled to speak on this considering that their own hands are not entirely clean of politicized science. My Opera built in ad blocker says it's blocked 29 ...

New Moon over S. Korea could doom US THAAD anti-missile system -- Puppet Masters -- Sott.net New Moon over S. Korea could doom US THAAD anti-missile system The alliance between the US and South Korea is expected to stay, but it is time for the new president in Seoul to rethink about how to deal with the THAAD anti-missile system, said Victor Gao from the China National Association of International Studies. Moon Jae-in, who was sworn in as the new South Korean president, looks ready to forge closer ties in Asia, including with North Korea. America's role in the region could be set to change as well, with Moon emphasizing that South Korea needs to stand its ground when it comes to Washington. Should we expect new Seoul-Beijing alliance in the region with a new president? First of all, let's congratulate President Moon for taking office at a very difficult time in South Korea, as well as on the Korean peninsula. As for relations between China and the Republic of Korea, it has been deteriorating mainly because of the US deployment of the THAAD system. And China-ROK economic relations have also taken a beating. Therefore, there is a lot of expectations for President Moon to really change course. First of all, I think we need to wait and see whether President Moon will have enough courage to discontinue the deployment of the THAAD in South Korea. And secondly, whether he will be able to pick up steam and strike for a rapprochement in relations with China and also - to follow the sunshine policy and improve the relations with DPRK. One word, which is very important: we do not want to see the breakout of war on the Korean peninsula; we want to see peace and stability maintained, and we devote our resources and focus on development rather than wars and conflicts. Moon's agenda seems to contradict the American one. Do you think Trump should be worried? I think the staunch alliance between the US and the Republic of Korea is expected to stay, but that doesn't mean the deployment of the THAAD anti-missile system in ROK by the US is the right decision. It completely antagonizes China, as well as Russia. And keeping the THAAD system in South Korea will do more harm than any good for the people in South Korea, and eventually, the US is not going to gain anything. Therefore it is time for the new president in Seoul to rethink about how to deal with a THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea ... I think the key questions are between North Korea and the United States. Therefore, South Korea is doing the right thing under the leadership of President Moon to position itself in a more conciliatory tone to DPRK through peaceful dialog with each other rather than warmongering. It will be interesting to see how hard the US fights, what incentives will be offered, what demands will be made, to keep THAAD in S. Korea if Moon Jae-in and the Korean people want it removed. New Moon over S. Korea could doom US THAAD anti-missile system The alliance between the US and South Korea is expected to stay, but it is time for the new president in Seoul to rethink about how to deal with the THAAD anti-missile system, said Victor Gao from...

In its annual spring ritual, the Pentagon brings its tin cup to Congress to beg for appropriations. Earlier this month, General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tried to explain to some bewildered members of Congress why the Pentagon required so much money when the United States already spends more than all its potential adversaries combined. U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a rather hawkish Democrat from California, balked at the request for $1.8 billion for a new nuclear-capable cruise missile that could strike targets 1,000 miles away. Her confusion was understandable. Early in his first term, Barack Obama became the first U.S. president to embrace nuclear disarmament. But the Pentagon continues to press for more nuclear weapons. In response to her question, Dempsey said that the missile was absolutely necessary. "Air defenses are improving around the world," he , and "keeping that capability to penetrate air defenses with our nuclear deterrent is an important one." The United States has probably the strongest nuclear deterrent in the world. It has many more nuclear weapons than it could conceivably need to deter other countries from foolishly imagining that they could attack America with impunity. And yet even the Pentagon argues that the air defenses of other countries -- missile defense -- could somehow weaken the U.S. ability to deter a missile attack. It shouldn't be that difficult for Dempsey to imagine his counterpart in Beijing making the same argument. In fact, his Chinese counterpart would have a much stronger argument to make. China has far fewer nuclear weapons and far fewer ballistic missiles than the United States. And the United States is the leading advocate of air defenses, particularly missile defense. So it's not difficult to understand why China is particularly upset that the United States is pushing its Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in northeast Asia. China is worried that a sufficiently robust missile defense system will lead the United States to believe that it could attack China with impunity. It's not a question of whether such a system could actually work in practice. The issue is one of perception. If the United States believes that THAAD works, it will feel less constrained about acting aggressively toward China. Back in the "good old days" of the Cold War, arms-control specialists understood that a missile defense race was just as bad as an arms race. If the United States and the Soviet Union began to pour money into what was then called ABM (anti-ballistic missile) sites, they would spur the other to increase spending on missiles to overwhelm those sites. They would then build more ABM sites. The two sides wisely concluded an ABM treaty in 1972 that limited the two sides to only one site each. The United States eventually withdrew from the treaty in 2002, the first major international arms treaty it abandoned. The missile defense genie is now out of the bottle, and many major powers are constructing their own systems. Even China has been developing a system similar to THAAD. The architects of the ABM treaty are now seeing their nightmares come true: a continued arms race compounded by an air defense race. The ostensible target of THAAD, however, is not China. The United States is urging its allies to adopt the system to guard against missiles launched by North Korea. At the moment, Japan and South Korea rely on Patriot missile defense -- PAC 2 and PAC 3 -- which guards against potential missile attacks at a lower altitude. THAAD would presumably defend against long-range missiles, including nuclear-tipped ones, though given the distances involved, the PAC systems seem more appropriate. North Korea's missile capabilities are certainly troubling. The recent test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile, even though a full working model is several years away, suggests that Pyongyang is not content to have just a couple of nuclear bombs to bolster its deterrence. But the way to address North Korea's nuclear and missile programs is to sit down and negotiate limits. Here, even THAAD advocates try to sound diplomatic. They argue that China will become so uncomfortable with the degradation of its own deterrent capability that it will pressure North Korea to return to the negotiating table. It seems, on the face of it, a clever argument. The problem is that North Korea rarely listens to China, particularly on military strategic issues. China has never been happy with North Korea's nuclear ambitions. It's very possible that Beijing is pursuing its own missile defense system as much to protect against what Pyongyang might do, deliberately or accidentally, as anything the United States has in mind. Right now, South Korea is divided on the issue, with the ruling party supporting THAAD and the opposition expressing skepticism. The debate may well come down to money, since THAAD is not cheap. In this case, the opposition's resistance will inadvertently help Park Geun Hye by providing her with a stronger argument that the United States should provide the system for free instead of pressuring South Korea into giving roughly $1 billion to military contractor Lockheed Martin for each THAAD battery. But THAAD is a waste of money, whoever is footing the bill. It has not been demonstrated to work effectively. It pushes China and North Korea to spend more money on more missiles to overwhelm THAAD (just as the United States is moved to spend more money on missile upgrades to counteract the missile defense of other countries). And it is a poor substitute for arms-control negotiations. Instead of letting Lockheed Martin determine the security politics of Northeast Asia, it's crucial to bring the diplomats back to the negotiating table to address the causes of insecurity and not just the symptoms.

Days later, China stepped up its stiff opposition to THAAD, a US-made missile defense system Between North Korea and China, the United States and Japan, sits the now leaderless South Korea. , making her the country's first president to be removed in such a manner. With the country's ruling conservatives, previously under Park, looking out of favor, it seems likely the country will turn to the left-wing opposition at the upcoming election. But looming over everything is North Korea -- can a liberal South Korean president pursue a dialogue with the North Koreans and not look weak? Following the ruling, Park is immediately removed as president of South Korea. Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn, the country's prime minister who took over after her impeachment by the National Assembly in December, will remain in the post until the election. The presidential campaign begins immediately and an election will be held within 60 days. No date has been announced yet. If Park hadn't been impeached she'd have remained in power until February 2018. A new leader after a two-month election was preferable to Park hanging on, weak and undermined for another year, Robert Kelly, associate professor at Pusan National University's Department of Political Science, told CNN. "This is a pretty scary time (in East Asia)," Kelly said. "The impeachment probably improves Korean stability, Korea's ability to act as a regional player. It's a little weird and a little hairy but it shouldn't be a catastrophe." It is almost certain Park, no longer subject to presidential immunity, will face charges in the corruption scandal that led to her impeachment, says Scott Snyder, senior fellow for Korean studies at the US-based Council of Foreign Relations, told CNN. "Clearly she is going to face criminal prosecution and it's just a matter of when," Snyder said. It's not clear when Park will leave the Blue House, where she spent time as a child, as the daughter of former president Park Chung-hee, and as the country's first female president. Liberal candidate Moon Jae-in from the opposition Democratic United Party is currently "Moon looks like the most likely candidate and unless something really unlikely happens, he'll be sailing to be the next president," Kim Hyung-a, associate professor at the Australia National University College of Asia and the Pacific, told CNN. He was the chief of staff to former South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and a strong proponent of the "Sunshine Policy", which attempted to improve relations between the two Koreas from 1998 to 2008. "(But) the North never really reciprocated," Kelly said. "While South Korea was providing assistance to the North, they kept building nuclear weapons." Former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had been seen as a potential contender for the presidency, but Park's dismissal changes the relationship between South Korea and the United States in one big way -- the THAAD deployment just became a lot more complicated. THAAD was due to be operational in South Korea by the end of 2017, during Park's remaining presidency, but her removal from office has thrown that into question. Both the South Korean and US governments have said THAAD is necessary to defend against North Korea, but the Chinese government has Experts said the United States would not be happy if the timeline around the controversial missile defense system changed. In the past South Korean liberals and the political opposition have questioned the value of the missile defense system to their country. But after China's resistance, Kelly said a left-wing South Korean president, such as Moon, would be far more conflicted. "The left doesn't think THAAD is that useful, it just provokes North Korea, but since China turned it into such a big deal now it looks like you're letting China bully you (if you stop it)," he said. The other major difference in a new administration's foreign policy could be North Korean relations. Things are tense on the Korean peninsula -- the North launched , also known as the East Sea, less than a week before Park's impeachment was confirmed. Snyder said a Moon presidency could see a push for negotiations with North Korea, rather than the pressure and sanctions of the previous administration, creating further divisions with the United States. "If you prioritize dialogue over pressure then that could open a gap between where I think the United States is going and where a new administration in South Korea might go," he said. But Kelly said the recent killing of Kim Jong Nam, which South Korea has blamed on North Korea, could make building negotiations even more difficult. North Korea has denied any involvement. North Korean state news agency KCNA, on the news of Park's dismissal, described her as a "common criminal." an abandoned computer belonging to Park's close friend and associate associate Choi Soon-sil. On the laptop, they allegedly found evidence Choi had used her influence to intervene in state affairs, despite not being a government official. The controversy quickly spiraled and soon Choi was in court, accused of abusing her relationship with Park to Even Lee Jae-yong, Samsung's de facto chief and prominent business leader, has been caught up in the turmoil. He is now Despite three televised public apologies by Park, mass public protests continued to call for her impeachment.

The Chinook multi-mission choppers were transporting equipment for THAAD, Yonhap news agency reported. A military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity confirmed the deployment. "We have been preparing materials and equipment needed for THAAD, the materials were moved in containers," the official told Yonhap, adding air transport was used in order to "reduce friction with residents." In March, Seoul's military and environmental authorities were met with some resistance, when local residents blocked a road being used to transport a large truck carrying equipment for environmental testing. Activists with the Seongju Struggle Committee to Stop THAAD Deployment said Tuesday the military moved two bulldozers, one excavator, two containers and two water tanks. The group is protesting the deployment and described it as an "illegal move" that is being "carried out without an environmental impact assessment." South Koreans are evenly divided about deployment: A poll taken in January indicated about 51 percent of respondents support THAAD. But officials in Seoul are moving forward on THAAD in coordination with the U.S. military. A handful of presidential candidates also voiced their complaints to a visiting Chinese official on Tuesday, local newspaper Segye Ilbo reported.

South Korea’s Kim Hong-kyun (L) meets China’s Wu Dawei, in Beijing, September 23, 2016. The two officials are tasked with handling Korean Peninsula affairs in their respective countries. A senior Chinese envoy has traveled to South Korea to discuss the controversial deployment of a US missile system in the South, to which Beijing is opposed, as well as North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. Wu Dawei, the special representative of the Chinese government for Korean Peninsula Affairs, arrived for a five-day visit in Seoul on Monday, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. Wu was due to meet with South Korea’s Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Peace and Security Affairs Kim Hong-kyun. The Chinese official is expected to express Beijing’s opposition to the recent installation of a US missile system in South Korea. He will also discuss North Korea, according to Yonhap. The US missile system, known as the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), is equipped with a powerful detection system known as an X band radar, which experts say would destabilize regional security and upset the region’s current military balance. Beijing has repeatedly announced its opposition to the deployment and vowed to defend its security interests. But South Korea and the US say the sole purpose of the THAAD system is to guard against potential missile threats from North Korea. A TV screen in a rail station in Seoul shows footage of a North Korean missile launch, April 5, 2017. (Photo by AFP) North Korea has so far conducted five confirmed nuclear tests and numerous missile test-launches. While it has not fired missiles against other countries, it has vowed strong action — including missile attacks against South Korea — if it is invaded by the South and the US. China, which is North Korea’s main ally, often backs Pyongyang but has had its own reservations about Pyongyang’s rapidly-developing missile and military nuclear programs. Beijing has already taken steps to increase pressure on Pyongyang over the matter. Meanwhile, the US, which has military forces in South Korea, is further stoking tensions with the North and China by deploying a navy strike group in the western Pacific Ocean near the Korean Peninsula. The strike group, which includes an aircraft carrier, will make its way from Singapore toward the peninsula, a US official told Reuters on Saturday. “We feel the increased presence is necessary,” the official was quoted as saying on the condition of anonymity. The UN on Thursday slammed the latest missile test launch by North Korea, and Japan extended its unilateral sanctions against Pyongyang over the matter. Chinese President Xi Jinping has arrived in the US state of Florida and held his first face-to-face meeting with President Donald Trump. South Korea struggles to reshape its policy towards North Korea as turmoil and growing tensions in the region hamper efforts for engagement with Pyongyang. North Korea launches a ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan just days after it warns the global community of retaliation over sanctions.

South Koreans Protest US THAAD Anti-Missile System as Installation Starts | News | teleSUR English Esta función esta colocada directamente en el template que la usa /post/TS_Preview A U.S. military vehicle which is a part of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system arrives in Seongju, South Korea, April 26, 2017. | Photo: Reuters The system will be online in the coming days in what some see as a move that could further escalate tensions with Pyongyang. Protesters clashed with police officers in Seongju County of South Korea when U.S. troops started transporting part of a missile defense system to the installation site nearby. Amid War Games US Missile Defense System Arrives in South Korea Six trailers were reportedly seen carrying x-band radar, mobile launchers and other elements of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, known as THAAD, entering the site. This overnight operation came after the U.S. Forces Korea secured the land and amid, what Washington claims, is North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile threat. THAAD is designed to intercept short, medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their flight. It is believed to be able to intercept missiles coming from North Korea. Local residents are afraid that after the installation, Seongju will become a priority target for North Korea’s missile attacks. They protested with pickets reading "No THAAD, No War" and "Hey, U.S.! Are you friends or occupying troops?" during the transportation. Some 8,000 police were dispatched to the scene and had a confrontation with those protesters. At least a dozen people were injured, including the elderly, according to Korea JoongAng Daily. The system will be operational in the coming days “to better defend South Korea against the growing North Korea threat,” U.S. Pacific Command Chief Adm. Harry Harris told the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday. South Korea's Ministry of National Defense also confirmed the installation and expected the test operation of the new system to start early next month, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. The deployment of THAAD had recently hurt Seoul's relationship with Beijing, which regards THAAD's powerful radar as a security and surveillance threat. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang urged South Korea and the U.S. to withdraw the equipment in his daily briefing Wednesday. “The deployment goes against efforts made by all parties to settle the issues through discussion and severely sabotage China's security and strategic interests,” Geng said. In fear of a potential nuclear war, female activists from more than 40 countries sent an open letter to President Trump demanding a peace deal with North Korea. They said deploying the controversial THAAD missile system in preparation for the war only fueled their fear. “We are united by our belief that diplomacy is the only way to resolve the nuclear crisis and threat of war now facing the Korean Peninsula,” the letter said. “Peace is the most powerful deterrent of all.” Amid War Games US Missile Defense System Arrives in South Korea Have you got more information on any of our stories?

These missiles were already in Korea, but now they are moving to their prepared site. They were set up at an airbase until the location was ready. Is this considered a meaningful defence against a small number of nuclear ballistic missiles or do they work in too short of a range where the protection would be meaningless when you factor in the fallout from the warheads? It's part of a wider missile defense system with Patriot missiles as the lowest altitude interceptors. Look at the effectiveness of Israel's defense systems to get an idea about how well ours would work against similar missiles. Thank you for your help. I don't know much about these systems but with volocities that these warheads are traveling it is difficult for me to understand how you would dump enough energy in to a defence missile to intercept at a range where no damage is done. There could still be kinetic damage from the velocity of the warhead but the lack of a nuclear explosion would still represent a significant reduction is destructive force. Just like Thad from BMS, we got the best defense in the league. "The missile carries no warhead, but relies on the kinetic energy of impact to destroy the incoming missile." WHICH ONE OF YOU ASSHOLES JUST STUCK HIS FINGER IN MY ASSHOLE!? I wonder what would happen if NK stole his pocket pussy. Thad would end up dictator of an SDT ravaged North Korea. not to be a total dickhead, but I helped build the target that thaad shoots down in practice, and the shit is real Victor Cha at CSIS said that SK needs 2 THAAD systems to deter all NK missiles. Let's get another one over there right away. How do they even know thaad works? No one is launching icbm's to test it are they? THAAD has only been tested on short-range missiles and IRBMs (3,000-5,500 km range). Those are the kind of missiles that only NK uses. That's why China shouldn't worry about THAAD negating their ICBM capabilities. They aren't worried about it being able to shoot down their ICBM's, they are worried about what the radar can see depending on what mode it is in. Its mostly for stopping nuclear missiles, nk still has a lot of artillery which cant be stopped by thaad or would be extremely expensive to stop Counter Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar – CRAM Gun Test Fire [1:46] Counter Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM or CRAM) or Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS), is a set of systems used to detect and/or destroy incoming artillery, rockets and mortar rounds in the air before they hit their ground targets such as war-fighting personnel and high-value assets. Here we go! About damn time! Even if there wasn't a war looming with North Korea, for the love of God, get this country some nuclear defenses! There's an idiot man-child across a small fence who has control over weapons that have the potential to turn cities into a crater! Hopefully this gets deployed before the currently winning new South Korean presidential candidate considers stopping it. Aegis is already in place and has been for some time. THAAD is new and was planned to deploy this year anyway. Yeah but they put THAAD up in an awful hurry. No one even knew it was being installed today and there's still no official confirmation yet. Can't help but suspect that the Presidential election and the recent tension with the North had something to do with it. The collective benefit isn't the point of the racket, its the benefit. In other words its better for everyone if we're all building and using air conditioners, but if you make tanks, peace kinda sucks! Well Tomahawks are Raytheon. Yes, Trump is invested in them. The Aegis system itself and the VLS system it uses is Lockheed, but the actual missiles are Raytheon. You also have other components that work with Aegis and almost all of them were built by one of those 2 companies. I'm out now, but I actually maintained part of the Aegis system on a DDG when I was in the Navy. I don't honestly know anything about THAAD. I should probably read about it some day. I believe Lockheed builds the Thaad missiles... Maybe just the launcher. I know Raytheon developed the radar and that Prat &amp; Whitney developed the boosters. THAAD is lockheed martin program based in Huntsville Alabama, LM is moving to an integration type model company instead of a manufacturing one edit: A lot of missile guidance systems used LM satellites, such as AEHF I don't know anything about stock trading. Can you not buy one stock? They arent that expensive I own a few shares of Lockheed and Raytheon. Lockheed is what $250ish a share and Raytheon is last I checked about $50. I wouldnt advice buying stock you have no experience in all willy nilly just because it is in the news. Do ya research first. The presidential election part is important. The US probably wanna get THAAD in before the new president is elected because he may not want it there due to the economic retaliation from China. China suspended all tours to Korea and have banned Korean entertainers from making appearances. They banned Korean TV shows and some products. They have also created a lot of anti-Korean feelings so that now companies like Hyundai Kia are not getting any sales. A lot of Korean companies rely on trade with China and on Chinese tourism and there are barely any Chinese people here now. Korea is hurting. Economic effects aside, I'm secretly glad about the lack of Chinese tourists. They were loud, rude, mucked up the subway and were generally unpleasant to have around. Yes but Korea has already made plans to work around this. To use other countries instead of China. Which idiot man-child who has control over weapons that have the potential to turn cities into craters do you mean? The one with the bad haircut! (I also watch John Oliver) The one who inherited an empire from his dad which he promptly ran into the ground, but insists that his empire is the best The one who can barely speak English, has a loyal group of core supporters, and who all other countries just see as a joke! Uhh... Oh! The one who lives the lavish lifestyle while abusing the system and fleecing the public! There's an idiot man-child across a small fence who has control over weapons that have the potential to turn cities into a crater! Any source on the idiot man-child part? Or are you talking about Trump? Why would anyone consider removing THAAD when you have a crazy neighbor that wants to kill you. Because if NK really wants to fuck up SK they don't even need to use missiles, just rockets will do the job. No need for an equivalent nuclear capability, that's just one upmanship and could make things worse. That's just a picture of a dirt golf course in the mountains. Doesn't show anything juicy. SEOUL The U.S. military has started moving parts of the controversial THAAD anti-missile defense system into a planned deployment site in South Korea, Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday, amid high tensions over North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. The United States and South Korea have agreed to deploy THAAD in response to the threat of missile launches by North Korea but China says it will do little to deter the North while destabilizing the regional security balance. The United States began moving the first elements of the advanced missile defense system into South Korea in early March after the North test-launched four ballistic missiles. can't they just catapult the nuke to South Korea or sneak it and set it off on-site? I don't know why they would do that when they could use a trebuchet, which uses a counterweight to launch a 90 kg projectile over 300 meters. Gotta be some brave North Koreans to launch a nuke and have it go off from .3 km away I think you're discounting Kim Jong Un's protective aura which shields North Korea at all times. I don't know why they would do that when they could use a 16 pounder naval gun which can launch a cannonball over 3,000 yards for the glory of his Royal Majestic King George III. Why would they use a trebuchet when they have a perfectly good giant rubber band tied to two trees? Actually I think thaad, or at least iron dome can shoot down mortar shells and artillery as well This is why I'm glad I got out of the military when I did. War is too deadly nowadays. My kids are going Air Force or Navy if they chose to sign up. I can't imagine being infantry and having to fight off T1000's, homing artillery shells that wipe out entire companies or any other sort of hi-tech that reduces the infantrymen's effectiveness to a walking meat sack. Edit: Yes I know this video is from 1953. It just serves as a reminder to me for how destructive war can be. Spoken like someone who has no idea how much worse war is in the nuclear era. Do you really think anything in the past compares to instant world obliteration within 2 hours of an all out nuclear attack? Do you not realize what a 300 Kiloton nuclear warhead can do? Do you not realize what 20,000 300 Kiloton nuclear warheads can do, launched over every major city on the planet? Do you not understand this would blot out the sun and kill 99% of humans on the Earth? Edit: It took a long long time to kill people before 1944. Now, in 2017? Fuck.....now we can destroy an entire nation in a single day...using conventional munitions. We don't even have to go nuclear. Have you never read WWi poetry? War is hell, it always has been. Yes, I went to school. Also, I'm a combat veteran who had to load up 17 coffins to be sent back home. WWI, WWII are peanuts compared to the death toll of WWIII and weapons of war that we have in storage today, for WWIII. The destructive power of the US military alone would end WWI or WWII in a single day of full scale attacks. I'm not joking. We are 1000x more deadly now then we have ever been in at any war in history. Imagine 10,000 of you and your buddies walk out onto a field in full armor, with tanks and armored troop carriers. Wait ten minutes....you are all dead. Thanks for playing. This is modern warfare. Ok now that got me thinking: how the fuck did those cameras survive? I believe it was a (relatively) small nuke with enough distance between the explosion and observation point Most analysts agree she hasn't made nukes that small yet. Missile warheads yes, artillery shells no. Assassinations very rarely to lead to positive change when talking into account state actors. That would be interesting. How would North Korea react if something like that were to happen? Would those in power send out the forces, or would they drop their arms and negotiate with the rest of the world? The issue is likely that it's difficult to ensure you're sniping the right person; he has body doubles. A shitshow like that is probably a lot deeper than its figurehead. Don't we have a heart attack gun? We probably have a bunch of ways to kill KJU but leaving power vacuums hasn't exactly turned out well for us The "Heart Attack Gun" supposedly used ice pellets laced with shellfish toxin. Of course, we have no evidence that the CIA actually said weapon (other than Frank Church holding up some kind of weapon saying they did -- which isn't really much to go on; I could've built what he's holding up) .. so we have to go to our second best source for busting myths. Mythbusters tested "ice pellets as projectiles" in their very first episode.. and their 14th. Both times they debunked the idea of using ice as a projectile. With that said, I'm going to say it's likely not a real thing. Well if Mythbusters can't do it I'm sure the US military can't. Supposedly there is also a gun that fires electromagnetic waves that interfere with the heart's electrical activity. If it even exists it would have to be used at pretty close range. That would have to be a pretty powerful little device.. and to be as powerful as it would need to be, I don't see someone sticking it in their pocket. Humans experience EMPs all the time. Hell, stun guns/tasers use EMPs. At that point it would probably be more effective just to cook the person outright, considering how much power you'd be using. Both times they debunked the idea of using ice as a projectile. I recall the episode. The powder charges used in testing were absolutely massive. The actual gun is a pistol, close quarters, assuredly sub-sonic. The Mythbusters can stage an effect. But it's not science and their debunking holds very little water. I thought it was more of a high intensity, low freuquency, narrow bandwith type of thing that essentially stresses the heart a general will take his place! somone who learned the lesson and will make a peaceful transition to democracy...yeah i know iam dreaming I know there's rules against that sort of stuff but I'm totally for it I wondered the same thing. I can only guess that they fear retaliation by his generals/China or the dude has body doubles. Or both. You think Kim is such a strong and mighty leader that he alone is keeping the entire nation enslaved? They had only planned to and set a date. I am sure they would have loved to do it faster but it's not always so simple. We're expecting highs of 80 mSv/hr with scattered gamma ray bursts in the late afternoon. If you're going shitty beer, might as well go full on Cass. If we're doing upscale shitty, I'll just grab Max. Yeah... It would be irresponsible NOT to have a missile defense system there at this point. This is all very similar to what was going on in 2003. I'm pretty sure Trump will only make it to the end of his presidency if he starts a war somewhere. Wars generally improve presidential approval ratings, for a time. Then if they drag on there is a severe negative effect. You need to hit the sweet spot. Keep in mind that Trump's strike on that Syrian airbase made his approval ratings go up. He's already tested the waters. South Korea has said China has discriminated against some South Korean companies in retaliation against the deployment. China should get their priorities straight. The most important thing right now is to shut down NK's regime and nuclear capabilities. Deploying the missile defence to SK is meant to protect countless of innocent lives. Come on China ... stop being a thorn in the ass Think about China what you want, but they do have a point about not wanting to have US military near their border. Beijing is just 600 miles away from Seoul. We won't need military bases there if North Korea is gone Considering how the US still has military bases in Germany, I find it a little unlikely that the US will loosen it's stranglehold on the Korean peninsula by relocating the bases elsewhere or shutting them down entirely. However, they also have the responsibility of protecting their 1 million expats in South Korea, a country that is still at war with their common neighbor. Then let China do something about NK if they don't want the US to. China, like Russia, as with any country, doesn't appreciate their neighbors being armed. because if shit goes down in the future... The only fair way to deescalate is to go back to the Armistice agreement. If you ever played Risk you always set up for the #2 target before you take out the #1. Would be interesting to see THAAD missiles intercept thousands of incoming large calibre artillery shells. got any sort of idea just how much a THAAD missile costs? Same. Although maybe were confusing them building space for it to be deployed. There is no construction with THAAD. It's supposed to be fully mobile. A bunch of trucks deploy in 1 hour and it's done. Don't know much about THAAD systems. Would the iron dome be beneficial on the border as well or is this basically the same thing? Iron Dome is for small rockets, THAAD is for things like Scuds. THAAD is also significant for anti ballistic missile systems in that it uses purely kinetic energy to physically hit the incoming missile rather than a thermobaric explosion or other similar means. Few systems use this as it requires an extremely accurate radar and guidance system and being off by even a fraction of a unit could result in a complete miss. THAAD is also being looked at as a solution to counter hypersonic kill vehicles as it is accurate enough and fast enough. This seems to outline the THAAD installation and its fallbacks / redundancies. THAAD was deployed in S. Korea more than a month ago. Looks like it was moved to Korea a month ago and it's getting installed now. They are mobile systems, it was probably bought in 3 months ago and they are just now allowing the public to know about it Plans were published in the Korean papers in 2016. Mar 2017, US and ROK papers published articles on the arrival. Theyve been protesting at the MND for like 2 months. I dont really understand the stance of the protesters, they were only barely mentioned in this article. Does anyone have some information on why they are against the deployment of THAAD? I was talking to my chinese friend who studies in Beijing and the chinese are incredible offensed by that. THAAD radar is powerful enough to cover Chinese (including Beijing) airspace. Maybe that's the reason. this is exactly the reason. the Chinese have expressed this concern before. Well then, maybe China should come up with something to resolve that. . It looks to me like it's kept in that bunker until it's needed, which makes me wonder what happens if there's an inbound missile and the truck won't start.

South Korea to Show Its Mettle as an Ally with THAAD Deployment? | The Weekly Standard South Korea to Show Its Mettle as an Ally with THAAD Deployment? ews agency reported on October 7 that “the only concern” Beijing has regarding the October 16 White House summit between President Obama and South Korean President Park Geun-hye is a possible discussion of “deployment of the THAAD missile defense system in the South.” Yonhap quoted Chinese professor Cheng Xiaohe of Renmin University as stating, at a recent seminar at Johns Hopkins University, that “China’s government explicitly opposed the implementation of THAAD systems on the Korean peninsula no matter in the U.S. military base or on the ROK’s military base.” The message is loud and clear: Beijing does not want a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) deployment in South Korea and is hoping that its new “charm” offensive to win over President Park can trump any considerations for her as a U.S. treaty ally. Sorry, you've reached the limit on the articles you can view. ews agency reported on October 7 that “the only concern” Beijing has regarding the October 16 White House summit between President Obama and South Korean President Park Geun-hye is a possible discussion of “deployment of the THAAD missile defense system in the South.” Yonhap quoted Chinese professor Cheng Xiaohe of Renmin University as stating, at a recent seminar at Johns Hopkins University, that “China’s government explicitly opposed the implementation of THAAD systems on the Korean peninsula no matter in the U.S. military base or on the ROK’s military base.” The message is loud and clear: Beijing does not want a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) deployment in South Korea and is hoping that its new “charm” offensive to win over President Park can trump any considerations for her as a U.S. treaty ally. Professor Cheng noted that China perceives a THAAD deployment as not only a threat to its military activities on its territory but also as an effort to further strengthen the military-to-military ties among the United States, Japan, and South Korea which “Beijing has long opposed.” This, of course, raises the question: What is an alliance for if not for allies to cooperate? Beijing is reportedly concerned that President Park will seek to balance her recent attendance at Beijing’s rather bombastic World War II victory parade by ceding to Washington’s interest in THAAD deployment. The old axiom that “a picture is worth a thousand words” seems to apply here. The recent photo from Tiananmen Square showing Park Geun-hye standing alongside China’s President Xi Jinping, clad in a modified Mao jacket, and Russia’s bullying leader Vladimir Putin certainly raised eyebrows in Washington, as did the fact that these VIPs stood on a dais above a large portrait of that same Mao Zedong who ordered China's "People’s Volunteer Army” forces into Korea in October 1950, thus preventing the unification of the peninsula under Seoul’s administration. For those who value human rights, the scene of columns of rolling tanks and marching PLA troops also brought an eerie reminder of a June night in 1989 when the Goddess of Democracy was toppled and hundreds of workers and students were gunned down in or near Tiananmen Square. Park was the only U.S. ally in sight at the parade, which had a chauvinistic and militarist flavor reminiscent of Soviet May Day parades in Red Square. The “Don’t Mess with China” message was sent, according to the , via the display of “a new missile reportedly capable of destroying an aircraft carrier.” And which nation deploys aircraft carriers to Pacific waters, even sending a carrier strike group into the Yellow Sea in 2010 as a show of support after the torpedoing by North Korea of a South Korean military vessel followed by the shelling of a South Korean island? That would be Seoul’s treaty ally, the United States. Meanwhile, in the U.N. Security Council, China effectively blocked Seoul’s efforts to designate North Korea as the perpetrator of the torpedo attack on the So why would South Korea’s president travel to the recent Beijing parade? Seoul has put forward the explanation that, as a middle power, it can effectively assist in diffusing tensions between Beijing and Washington over China as a rising power. It also hopes to act as a conduit for opening further development in some of northeast Asia’s more backward regions in and adjacent to North Korea. Then there is the elusive dream in Seoul that Xi Jinping will eventually grow weary of his troublesome North Korea ally and lend a sympathetic ear to South Korean plans for a peaceful, Seoul-centered reunification of the peninsula. And some in South Korea have asserted that an indigenous system, the Korean Air and Missile Defense System (KAMD), could equally meet South Korea’s defense needs (many other analysts dispute this) while avoiding being caught between Washington and Beijing. This concern over being put in the middle only increased following Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wanquan’s February visit to Seoul. Chang reportedly made Beijing’s unhappiness over a potential THAAD deployment in Korea perfectly clear to his South Korean counterpart. Yet it was none other than the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Commander, General Curtis Scaparrotti, speaking at a forum hosted by the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in June 2014, who called for the deployment of THAAD in South Korea. “It is a U.S. initiative and, in fact, I recommend it as the commander,” he was quoted as stating by news agency. General Scaparrotti, due to the postponement of the transfer of wartime operational control over allied forces (OPCON transfer), retains command of South Korean, as well as U.S., forces during any future conflict on the Korean peninsula. The decision to delay OPCON transfer was announced in October 2014 after Seoul’s direct request for the postponement. It would seem only judicious to give your commander all the tools he has designated as required to carry out his mission. And it would only be fair that the 28,500 U.S. forces forward deployed in Korea, whose lives were most recently put at risk during the cross-DMZ shelling incident this past summer, should be given every possible protection from the North Korean missile threat that their commander warrants is necessary. Summits such as the one taking place between the American and South Korean presidents often have what are called “deliverables” to demonstrate that these meetings have substance as well as symbolism. In 2011, for example, President Park’s predecessor, former South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, witnessed final Congressional ratification of the South Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) at the time of his Washington visit. Securing a similar agreement on THAAD deployment in South Korea would not only add some substance to President Park’s visit but could put to rest Washington whispers that her recent flirtations with China demonstrate she is not an alliance “team player.” Agreeing to THAAD would also prove her mettle as a staunch American ally in a time of shifting power balances in East Asia. Dennis P. Halpin, a former adviser on Asian issues for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is a visiting scholar at the U.S.-Korea Institute and an adviser to the Poblete Analysis Group.

In a defiant bit of timing, South Korea announced Wednesday that key parts of a contentious U.S. missile defense system had been installed a day after rival North Korea showed off its military power. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Amid alarm over North Korea's expanding nuclear weapons and missile arsenal, Washington and Seoul are speeding ahead with the installment of an advanced U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea to cope with the growing threats. Despite the seemingly straightforward purpose, the deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, remains a controversial topic in South Korea and even has become an issue in the upcoming presidential election. Here's a look at how THAAD works and why it became a debated issue in South Korea. A THAAD battery, including the one currently being installed in southern South Korea, consists of six truck-mounted launchers that can fire up to 48 interceptor missiles. There is also fire control and communication equipment and a powerful X-band radar officially known as AN/TPY-2. THAAD is designed to take out incoming targets in midflight at relatively high altitudes and military experts say the system could provide protection against North Korea's midrange missiles. Some experts believe South Korea will eventually need more THAAD systems to cover a broader part of its territory if it wants to counter recent efforts by the North to beef up its arsenal of solid-fuel midrange missiles that can be fired from mobile launchers and submarines. The United States and South Korea began installing THAAD last month and South Korea's Yonhap news agency said Wednesday that key parts, including six launchers, interceptor missiles and a radar, have been deployed. South Korea's Defense Ministry confirmed there was progress in the system's installment, but didn't specify which parts of THAAD were deployed. The ministry said Seoul and Washington have been pushing to get THAAD operating soon. The plan to deploy THAAD has angered North Korea as well as China, which sees the system as a security threat despite reassurances that the system is purely defensive. South Korea has raised suspicions that China is retaliating against plans for THAAD by limiting Chinese tour group visits to South Korea, whose economy is increasingly dependent on Chinese tourism and demand for its industrial products. China says that THAAD's radar can be reconfigured to peer deep into its territory and monitor its flights and missile launches. Military experts outside of China say Beijing's worries are exaggerated and THAAD in South Korea wouldn't meaningfully improve U.S. monitoring ability when Washington already watches Chinese missile launches through radar systems installed in Qatar, Taiwan and Japan. They say there's little reason to reconfigure the THAAD radar in South Korea to a "forward-based mode" when that would disable the system from intercepting incoming missiles. Residents in the rural South Korean town of Seongju, where the first THAAD battery will sit in a converted golf course, have expressed worries about rumored health hazards linked to the system's radar. South Korea's Defense Ministry says such worries are groundless and no such issues have been reported at THAAD sites in other countries. South Korean presidential front-runner Moon Jae-in has vowed to reconsider the deployment if he wins the May 9 election, saying that the country should consider relations with China. He says that the security benefits of THAAD would be curtailed by worsened relations with the country's biggest trading partner. His camp issued a statement Wednesday denouncing the installment and saying public opinion was being ignored. Moon's closest competitor, Ahn Cheol-soo, has voiced support for THAAD deployment, but has also said he would be willing to ask the U.S. to withdraw the system of China agrees to aggressively pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions.

South Korean defense ministry officials and U.S. military officials could not immediately be reached for confirmation. The United States began moving the first elements of the advanced missile defense system into South Korea in early March after the North test-launched four ballistic missiles. But the U.S. and South Korean militaries have been reluctant to publicly discuss the progress of the deployment as candidates in a May 9 presidential election debated whether the move should go ahead or be delayed until after the vote. South Korea has said China has discriminated against some South Korean companies in retaliation against the deployment.

U.S. THAAD missile defense system reportedly deployed to South Korean site U.S. THAAD missile defense system reportedly deployed to South Korean site Want to know what Chris Christie will do once his term is up? Too bad. Trump says he has no investments in Russia, is 'in total compliance in every way' Major confectioners band together to whittle down calories, sugars in packaged sweets U.S. THAAD missile defense system reportedly deployed to South Korean site A U.S. missile defense system that China views as a threat to its own military capabilities was Area residents watched as six trailers carrying Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) equipment arrived at a golf course, and the Yonhap news agency reports that the delivery caused clashes between the locals and police. The system is designed to intercept and destroy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles during their last flight stage, and is being deployed to counter the threat from North Korea. North Korea is thought to be readying for its sixth nuclear weapons test. During his visit to South Korea earlier this month, Vice President Mike Pence and the country's acting president agreed to an early deployment of the missile defense system. China has been vocal about its opposition to THAAD, as have South Koreans who think it escalates the situation with North Korea. U.S. THAAD missile defense system reportedly deployed to South Korean site A week after his inauguration, President Trump invited former FBI Director James Comey to a private dinner at the White House, where he demanded his loyalty, several Comey associates Comey said the pair made small talk about the election and the size of Trump's inaugural crowd before the president asked Comey if he would "pledge his loyalty to him," the reports. Comey said no, he would not be "reliable" in the political sense, but he would always be honest. Later in the meal, Trump again stated he needed Comey's loyalty, and Comey repeated that he would give him "honesty." FBI directors are meant to be independent of the president, and Comey, who was fired Tuesday by Trump, told associates he now believes this was the beginning of the end for him. He also said he was concerned about how it would look for him to have a solo dinner with the president while the FBI was investigating possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. The White House told the Want to know what Chris Christie will do once his term is up? Too bad. Ever since he went from being a Donald Trump foe in the early days of the 2016 presidential race to rumors have swirled that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) will somehow wind up a member of the Trump administration. When asked on Thursday if he could potentially replace James Comey as the next FBI director, that he will stay on as governor until the end of his final term in January, before bluntly declaring, "and in terms of what I'm going to do afterwards? None of your business." Christie also stayed mum on whether he thought it was a good idea to dismiss Comey, saying, "It's not my place to say if I agree or disagree." He did feel comfortable sharing that he thinks there's no need for a special prosecutor to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, and anyone who believes otherwise wants to turn the investigation into "a political circus." Want to know what Chris Christie will do once his term is up? Too bad. Trump says he has no investments in Russia, is 'in total compliance in every way' that he has "no investments in Russia, none whatsoever," and he thinks a certified letter his law firm sent to Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) is enough to prove it. "I don't have property in Russia," Trump said. "A lot of people thought I owned office buildings in Moscow. I don't have property in Russia, and I am…in total compliance in every way." He also told Holt that he wants the FBI investigation into possible ties between Russia and Trump's campaign "to be absolutely done properly," even though as far as he's concerned it "should have been over with a long time ago. 'Cause all it is is an excuse, but I said to myself, 'I might even lengthen out the investigation, but I have to do the right thing for the American people.'" Trump said he wants the investigation to be "so strong and so good," and when asked by Holt if his firing of former FBI Director James Comey was a warning to Comey's ultimate replacement to step back from the Russia probe, Trump responded, "If Russia hacked, if Russia did anything having to do with our election, I want to know that." Holt then reminded Trump that intelligence agencies have come forward and said Russia tried to influence the election. "If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections I think it's a horrible thing," Trump said. "I want to get to the bottom of it." Trump went on to deny there was any "collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians," adding, "The Russians did not affect the vote." Trump says he has no investments in Russia, is 'in total compliance in every way' On Thursday, a jury found former Rep. Corrine Brown, accused of taking money from a charity that claimed it was giving scholarships to needy students, Brown, a Democrat from Florida, was first elected in 1993, and last fall, lost her seat after she was indicted. Brown's indictment said the One Door for Education Foundation brought in more than $800,000 between 2012 and 2016, but gave out just one scholarship, worth $1,200, to an unknown Floridian. Prosecutors say Brown received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fake charity and used the money to take expensive trips and throw extravagant parties. Brown, 70, pleaded not guilty to all charges, and testified that she had no idea how the money was being used, blaming the theft on Elias "Ronnie" Simmons, her former chief of staff and president of One Door. Simmons pleaded guilty and testified against Brown, saying she ordered him to transfer money from One Door's bank account to hers; he also said he sometimes kept funds for himself. Brown won't be sentenced for at least three months. believe President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday was inappropriate, an NBC News/Survey Monkey poll released Thursday revealed. The poll, which landed just two days after Trump abruptly axed Comey, found 54 percent of Americans did not believe Comey's ouster was "appropriate." Only 38 percent thought it was. that those percentages "almost perfectly track Trump's latest approval numbers (38 percent to 55 percent) in the Gallup tracking poll." Americans' confidence in the investigation into Trump's ties to Russia. NBC reported that more than half of Americans (55 percent) said Trump's move to fire Comey made them "less confident" that the investigation could be carried out "fairly," while 36 percent said it made them "more confident." The poll was carried out from May 10 to 11 among 3,746 likely voters. Its margin of error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. managed to seamlessly roll together two unrelated controversies in its cover for next week: An early look at the cover — which is cleverly titled "Ejected" — painted the scene from a United Airlines flight last month in which a paying customer from an overbooked flight.

South Korean protesters hold placards during a rally against the planned deployment of the US-built Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), outside Lotte International, in Seoul, February 27, 2017. (Photo by AFP) The South Korean people residing near a golf course turned over to the country’s military by a major retail company to host a controversial US missile system have sued the Defense Ministry. The lawsuit, filed by residents of Seongju County and neighboring Gimcheon on Tuesday, claimed that the ministry had bypassed legally-required procedures, including prior agreement from local people and an environmental impact assessment. The legal action was launched hours after a subsidiary of South Korea’s giant retailer Lotte Group signed a deal with the ministry to hand over the golf course in the southeast of the country in exchange for a piece of military-owned land on the outskirts of the capital Seoul. “This is only the beginning of our legal battles to stop this project,” said attorney Kim Yu-Jeong in a press briefing outside the ministry, where dozens of activists and residents also gathered to stage a protest rally.

(Photo by AFP) Protest leader in Seongju County, Kim Chung-Hwan, said that hundreds of soldiers and riot police had been deployed at the golf course to guard its entrances. The South Korean military also reportedly planned to use helicopters to bring in barbed wire fencing to close off the site. Lotte Group has also come under intense pressure by its key target market China over the land swap. The scheme by the US and South Korean militaries to station the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system in response to threats allegedly from North Korea has enraged China, which says the move will challenge its own security. The Yonhap news agency cited an unnamed South Korean Defense Ministry official as saying that the THAAD system would be in place as early as May or June. Under its land swap deal with the South Korean military, the Lotte Group would provide 1,480,000 square meters of land in Seongju — with an estimated value of 7.9 million dollars — for 67,000 square meters of land on the outskirts of Seoul. China has warned the US and South Korea against the deployment of THAAD missile system. A plan to deploy an advanced US missile system to South Korea may be causing more problems for South Korean companies operating in China. The South Korean Defense Ministry says Seoul and Washington have agreed to deploy the advanced American missile system on Korean territory this year.
South Korea deploys parts of US THAAD system | South Korea News | Al Jazeera News agency says launchers, intercept missiles and radar of controversial THAAD system have been installed. says key parts of a contentious US missile defence system have been installed a day after rival The work to set up the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, within this year has angered North Korea, and Russia, which see the system's powerful radars as a security threat. South Korea said in a statement on Wednesday that unspecified parts of THAAD were deployed. The statement said Seoul and Washington have been pushing to get THAAD working soon to cope with North Korea's advancing nuclear and missile threats. South Korea's Yonhap news agency said six launchers, some intercept missiles and at least one radar have been deployed. Washington and Pyongyang have been ratcheting up pressure on each other in recent weeks, with the sending a aircraft carrier group and nuclear submarine to the region and North Korea attempting more missile launches in defiance of layers of UN sanctions. had supervised the country's "largest ever" live-fire drill to mark the 85th founding anniversary of its military, with more than 300 large-calibre, self-propelled artillery guns demonstrating their firepower at an event on its east coast. The firing drill came instead of a nuclear test or the launch of a long-range missile as feared amid pressure from the US and China, its sole major ally which has been irritated by Pyongyang's weapons development. The US and South Korea agreed to deploy THAAD in response to the threat of missile launches by North Korea. However, the move has angered China, which is concerned that the system's powerful radar can penetrate its territory and undermine its security. South Korea's defence ministry said some elements of the THAAD system were moved to the site on what had been a golf course in the county of Seongju in the country's southern region. The US and South Korean militaries have been reluctant to publicly discuss the progress of the deployment as candidates in a May 9 presidential election debated whether the move should go ahead or be delayed until after the vote. Television footage showed military trailers carrying large units including what appeared to be launch canisters being driven into the planned THAAD battery site, about 250km south of Seoul. Images showed local protesters hurling water bottles at the vehicles and police trying to block them. A US submarine designed to carry 150 Tomahawk cruise missiles entered a South Korean port on Tuesday as the USS Carl Vinson carrier group steamed towards the Korean waters in an effort to deter the North from a sixth nuclear test and more missile launches. South Korea's navy has said it plans to hold a joint drill with the US strike group late this month. Content on this website is for general information purposes only.

US and South Korea agree 'early' deployment of THAAD missile defence system | The Independent US and South Korea agree 'early' deployment of THAAD missile defence system Decision comes as US Vice President Mike Pence warns North Korea that the 'era of strategic patience is over' Aid workers 'lucky to be alive' after Libyan warship stops rescue have agreed to the early activation of a defence system designed to shoot down The decision to activate the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system came during talks between the acting South Korean President Hwang Kyo Ahn and Mike Pence, as the US Vice President warned North Korea that the "era of strategic patience is over". At a joint press conference with Mr Pence today, Mr Hwang said: "We have agreed to further strengthen the readiness posture of [the] ROK-US alliance that matches the threats posed by North Korea through a swift deployment of THAAD." A failed North Korean missile test on Sunday, when an unidentified projectile exploded moments after being launched in an eastern port city, came in defiance of US President Donald Trump's demands for the country to wrap up its nuclear programme. Top US security official says 'all options are on the table' when it comes to dealing with North Korea Operations to install the THAAD began in early March, the day after the North launched four ballistic missiles, when the United States flew in the "first elements" of the system to a military base near the South Korean capital Seoul. It has a range of 200km, and is capable of destroying incoming warheads by intercepting them mid-flight. The system has previously been installed in Guam and Hawaii. Speaking at the time, Chinese foreign spokesperson Geng Shuang said China was "firmly opposed" to the deployment, and would "resolutely take measures to defend our own security interests". He reiterated China's in a press conference earlier today. US Marine soldiers patrol during the US-South Korea joint Exercise Operation Pacific Reach in Pohang, South Korea.

China's President Xi Jinping set out his opposition to the deployment of an advanced US missile system, in his first discussion with new South Korean leader Moon Jae-in on Thursday. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) missile system, aimed at intercepting attacks from North Korea, was made operational in South Korea last week. But Beijing said the system will spy on its territory and strongly criticised its deployment and the relations between the two countries have deteriorated over the issue, BBC reported. A South Korean presidential spokesman said the Chinese leader -- who initiated the phone call on Thursday -- "explained the reasons for Beijing's strong and repeated opposition" to the deployment, Yonhap news agency reported. Moon also raised the issue of apparent economic retaliation against South Korean firms in China, he said. Moon said he will send a delegation to Beijing to discuss both North Korea and THAAD. The THAAD deployment was agreed by Moon's predecessor, conservative leader Park Guen-hye. She is currently in prison awaiting trial on corruption charges. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said the two sides expressed willingness "to bring (relations) back to a healthy and stable development track". Both Moon and Xi agreed that denuclearising North Korea was a "common goal". Moon advocated dialogue with the North as well as sanctions, adopting a more conciliatory stance than his predecessor.

Effort to clean up ocean plastic to begin in 12 months, years ahead of schedule (UTRECHT, Netherlands) -- A Dutch foundation dedicated to removing plastic pollution from the world’s oceans announced a new system design today that will allow them to begin an ambitious cleanup plan in the next 12 months, two years ahead of schedule. The Ocean Cleanup said Thursday its new system features an anchor that does not attach to the ocean seabed, instead floating with the ocean currents. The anchor is deep enough to keep the system moving slower than the plastic that floats on the ocean's surface. The system can then catch plastic inside its barrier. “As long as the system moves slower than the plastic, it will still collect the plastic,” said the 22-year-old head of the foundation, Boyan Slat, at a press conference accompanying the announcement today. Slat went on to say that the new design allows the system to act like “plastic magnets” traveling in the current to the places in the ocean with the highest concentrations of plastic. About 80 percent of marine debris originates as land-based trash, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Plastic debris in particular presents physical and chemical hazards to marine life because it often gets mistaken for food by birds and fish, the EPA says. “To catch the plastic, act like the plastic,” Slat said. He hopes to have multiple systems working simultaneously in different parts of the Pacific Ocean. Slat estimates that if the plan is successful, they will be able to clean up 50 percent of the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch in five years. Scientists and environmental advocates have identified several so-called patches of marine debris floating in the world's oceans, but scientists caution that the term doesn't accurately describe the scope of the problem because much of the plastic in the oceans breaks down to small parts that are not easily visible. Slat said the first element of the floating pipe is being made in California now and that the new design allows the organization to gradually scale up funding and increase financial viability. Slat, who was inspired to help clean up the ocean after a SCUBA diving trip said, “We can do this, we must do this and we will do this.” (LUXEMBOURG) -- Princess Kate was greeted by cheering fans on Thursday in Luxembourg on her second solo royal tour.

Activists arrested in Moscow after demanding investigation of alleged torture of gay men (MOSCOW) -- Five LGBT activists have been arrested in Moscow as they tried to deliver a petition calling on Russian authorities to investigate the alleged detention and torture of dozens of gay men in Chechnya. One of the activists from the group LGBT Network, Nikita Safranov, spoke to ABC News from inside the police station where he and the four others were being detained. Safranov said they were arrested today while walking toward the offices of Russia’s prosecutor general, Yury Chaika, in central Moscow. The group was carrying large stacks of boxes stamped with the words “Justice for the Chechen 100” and filled with copies of the petition. Safranov said they expected to be charged with staging an unsanctioned demonstration. The group's petition, which was launched on Change.org, calls for Russia’s prosecutor to investigate recent reports that more than 100 men have been kidnapped and tortured by authorities in Chechnya as part of an alleged roundup targeting the gay community there. Reports of the alleged roundup emerged in early April after the independent newspaper, , published articles detailing accounts of how Chechen security forces were detaining the men and holding them in secret prisons. The newspaper said sources in Chechnya’s security services and the LGBT community described the detentions as a “prophylactic purge” against homosexuals in the southern Russian republic, where homosexuality is widely viewed as shameful. Since then, testimonies have emerged from some of the men detained, detailing brutal tortures. One man, who requested anonymity in an interview with ABC News last month, described how Chechen law enforcement agents had kept him in jail for a week, beat him with plastic rods and tortured him with electric shocks. Testimony from the man, whom ABC News is identifying as Z., and from other men published in s said the agents demanded that those detained name other gay men, forming a chain of terror. , told ABC News that the newspaper believes around 200 men had been detained and that it has proof that at least three men had been killed during the purge. Z., who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concerns for his safety, told ABC News he was released after the agents could find no proof he was gay. But he then fled Chechnya when a mutual acquaintance was detained, fearing authorities would return for him again. Some of the victims said police had handed them back to their families after the detentions and told them they should kill them themselves to save their honor. Chechen authorities have denied that the detentions are taking place. A spokesman for Ramzan Kadyrov, the region’s president, has said such persecutions were impossible because Chechnya does not have gay men. The regional branch of the Prosecutor’s Office in Chechnya has opened an investigation into the reports, but the denunciations from Kadyrov, who personally controls law enforcement in the region, has cast doubt that it will find anything. The Kremlin has also been reluctant to respond to the reports. President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, initially told reporters that anyone suffering abuses should report them to law enforcement. Putin himself commented publicly for the first time on the reports last week, saying he would ask federal law enforcement to investigate. The alleged detentions have prompted condemnation from around the world. The foreign ministers of Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, France and Sweden sent a joint letter last week calling on Russia to investigate. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley issued a statement in April saying the abuses “cannot be ignored.” The State Department said it was “deeply disturbed” by the reports. LGBT Network has been helping gay men to leave Chechnya. To date, it has helped 42 people escape, the organization told ABC News. Some of these men have been provided with safe-houses in Russia, but the organization is trying to get them asylum abroad in Europe or the United States. Igor Kochetkov, the group's director, said three European countries were examining the possibility of offering asylum, but no offers have been made so far. (BEIJING) -- In his first discussion with the new South Korean leader, Chinese President Xi Jinping asserted that he doesn't want South Korea to deploy a U.S. missile system, according to the BBC. The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, which would intercept attacks from North Korea, became operational in South Korea last week. A spokesperson for the liberal leader Moon Jae-in said Xi, who initiated the call, "explained the reasons for Beijing's strong and repeated opposition" to the deployment, Yonhap news agency reported. Beijing has said the system would spy on its territory. Moon, who was elected South Korean president on Tuesday, has made ambivalent comments about THAAD in the past, but during the call, both he and Xi agreed that denuclearising North Korea was a "common goal," according to the BBC. "President Moon said the THAAD issue can be resolved when there is no further provocation by North Korea," spokesman Yoon Young-chan said. Moon also raised the issue of economic retaliation against South Korean firms in China, Yoon said. The South Korean president is expected to send a delegation to Beijing to discuss both North Korea and THAAD. The THAAD deployment was agreed upon by Moon's predecessor, conservative leader Park Guen-hye. She is currently awaiting trial in prison on corruption charges. Russian firm under FBI investigation offers to help any federal investigation (WASHINGTON) -- A world-renowned software company -- the Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab -- says it wants to dispel security concerns about its products by helping any government probe of the company. "Kaspersky Lab is available to assist all concerned government organizations with any ongoing investigations, and the company ardently believes a deeper examination of Kaspersky Lab will confirm that these allegations are unfounded," the company says in a statement posted Wednesday on its website. The statement follows an ABC News report earlier this week that disclosed a long-running FBI probe of the company, and detailed growing concerns among U.S. officials that Russian spies might try to exploit Kaspersky Lab to snoop on Americans or sabotage key U.S. systems. For years, the FBI has been investigating whether Kaspersky Lab maintains any troubling relationships with the Russian government, and the U.S. agency has been trying to uncover any possible efforts to collect intelligence on Americans, sources with knowledge of the probe told ABC News. In recent months, FBI agents have taken further action to move their probe forward, including a review of records related to Kaspersky Lab, sources said. In February, the Department of Homeland Security issued a secret report on the company. And just last month, in a secret memorandum sent to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Senate Intelligence Committee raised possible red flags about Kaspersky Lab and urged the intelligence community to address potential risks posed by the firm’s powerful market position. "This [is an] important national security issue," declared the bipartisan memorandum, described to ABC News by congressional sources. Kaspersky Lab products are widely used in homes, businesses and government agencies throughout the United States, having secured contracts with the Federal Bureau of Prisons and segments of the Defense Department. Current and former U.S. officials expressed concern over Kaspersky Lab executives with previous ties to Russian intelligence and military agencies. The company’s founder and chief executive officer, Eugene Kaspersky, was trained at a coding academy sponsored by the KGB. Subsequently, current and former U.S. officials worry that Kaspersky Lab’s software could allow state-sponsored hackers to steal and manipulate users’ files, read private emails or attack critical infrastructure in the United States. "There’s absolutely knowledge amongst senior government officials that this company is potentially a threat to U.S. national security interests," according to Michael Carpenter, who until January served as the Defense Department's deputy assistant secretary for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. But in its statement Tuesday, Kaspersky Lab insisted: "As a private company, Kaspersky Lab has no ties to any government, and the company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts." "The company has a 20-year history in the IT security industry of always abiding by the highest ethical business practices, and Kaspersky Lab believes it is completely unacceptable that the company is being unjustly accused without any hard evidence to back up these false allegations," the statement said. In fact, the FBI and other agencies in the U.S. intelligence community have yet to publicly present any evidence connecting company executives with Russian security services. And sources who spoke with ABC News did not offer any evidence suggesting Kaspersky Lab has helped breach a U.S. system or taken hostile action on behalf of the Russian government. "For 20 years, Kaspersky Lab has been focused on protecting people and organizations from cyberthreats, and its headquarters' location doesn't change that mission," Kaspersky Lab said in its statement. "[J]ust as a U.S.-based cybersecurity company doesn’t allow access or send any sensitive data from its products to the U.S. government, Kaspersky Lab products also do not allow any access or provide any private data to any country's government." But, in discussing their concerns about Kaspersky Lab, current and former U.S. officials also point to Russia's System of Operative-Investigative Measures (SORM), which "legally permits authorities to monitor and record all data that traverses Russia’s networks," according to the State Department. Russian authorities must obtain a court-approved warrant to collect a customer’s information from a company. But the company doesn't always get to see the warrant, and authorities may lawfully gather information on anyone else later tied to the targeted customer "so long as the new targets are part of the same operation," according to a State Department fact sheet about SORM obtained by ABC News. "In practice, these are very broad powers," and "Russia's approach is more flexible and intrusive than similar Western systems," the State Department wrote. In an interview with ABC News, Eugene Kaspersky said, "My response if I’m asked to spy on anyone coming from any state, any government -- not only Russian -- will be definite 'no.'" According to the company, customers "have full control" over what data is shared, and they can opt out if they don’t want even anonymized data sent through servers in foreign locations like Russia, where it might be subject to collection under SORM. Also, enterprise and government users can install a local "Kaspersky security network center on their premises to make sure the data never leaves their facility or country," a spokeswoman for the company said. In its statement, the company noted that the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology has certified its encryption technologies for businesses as "fully compliant" with federal standards, which demonstrates that company products "are trusted to secure sensitive data." ABC News asked Eugene Kaspersky whether the Kremlin could force his company to target the United States. He responded, "I think it's hardly possible." Experts emphasize there is one key thing to remember about Kaspersky Lab: "They do some good things, and they have good products," said Carpenter, the former Defense Department official. Founded in 1997, the company boasts an estimated 400 million users in nearly 200 countries. And it reportedly rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, not only through its anti-virus software but also through the analysis it conducts about emerging threats. "We do not care who's behind the cybercampaigns we expose,” Eugene Kaspersky said in 2015, responding to a Bloomberg News report about his alleged ties to Russian officials. "There is cyber-evil, and we fight it." In 2013, Kaspersky Lab outed what it called Red October, an alleged Russian hacking campaign to spy on diplomatic agencies in Eastern Europe. Kaspersky Lab researchers were also behind the discovery of Stuxnet, the U.S. National Security Agency's special cyberbomb targeting Iranian nuclear facilities in 2009 and 2010. In years past, Eugene Kaspersky repeatedly met with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies across the world to share information about emerging threats and discuss "the best solutions for fighting cybercrime," according to Kaspersky Lab. However, "unfortunately we are losing our contacts with FBI ... because of the geo-political situation," Eugene Kaspersky told ABC News. “We were sharing this information, but now it's getting more and more hard to do that.” (JOHANNESBURG) – Wednesday marked the anniversary of Nelson Mandela's inauguration as South Africa's first democratically-elected president in 1994. Mandela stepped down from office in 1999 after Mandela spent his life fighting to end apartheid in South Africa. In 1962, when Mandela was leader of the African National Congress, he was captured by the South African government and tried for sabotage and treason in what has become known as the Rivonia Trial. When facing the death penalty on April 20, 1964, Mandela famously said: "I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die." Mandela was released from prison on Sunday, Feb. 11, 1990. He voted for the first time in his life on April 27, 1994, and went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. He inspired social change through his words. Some of his other famous quotes include: “It is in your hands, to make a better world for all who live in it.” "There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered."

Trump will face decades of Israeli-Palestinian talks on first trip to 'get it done' (WASHINGTON) -- It's an achievement that has proved elusive, yet continues to be a top objective for each successive American president: Middle East peace. Aaron David Miller, a veteran peace negotiator for both Republican and Democratic administrations, said about President Trump on Twitter last week, "never in decades of involvement have I heard a U.S. president more confident with less prospect." Another longtime Middle East diplomat, Robert Danin, replied to Miller on Twitter: "But have you seen one less confident with greater prospect?" Next week, Trump travels to Israel on his first overseas trip, where he is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank. "It’s something that I think is, frankly, maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years," Trump quipped during Abbas' visit to the White House last week. "Throughout my lifetime, I've always heard the toughest deal to make is the deal between Israelis and Palestinians," he said during a brief joint appearance with Abbas, "let's see if we can prove them wrong." The 82-year-old Abbas has participated in several past negotiations and signed the Oslo Accords in 1993. "With you, we now have hope," Abbas told Trump in English. And Trump told Abbas, "I want you to be the Palestinian leader to sign the final agreement with Israel." Historically, Washington’s approach has been, "We know what the final deal will look like, we just have to get the two parties there," according to Jonathan Schanzer, a research fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, D.C. The new thinking, he told reporters last week, seems to say, "We want a deal but we don't know what that final framework will look like." The Palestinians have little to lose, analysts say, and Trump has already exceeded their expectations just by extending an invitation to the White House, the first Abbas has received in three years. Netanyahu was invited before Abbas to the White House, visiting in February and holding a joint news conference with Trump. "Bibi," Trump said at the time, using the prime minister's nickname, "and I have known each other for a long time -- smart man, great negotiator." "I'm looking at two states and one state, and I like the one both parties like," Trump said at the joint news conference with Netanyahu. "I can live with either one." "Let us seize this moment together," Netanyahu said, "Let us bolster security. Let us seek new avenues of peace." During his meeting, Abbas pitched the same platform Palestinians have presented for years. "Mr. President," Abbas said, "our strategic option, our strategic choice is to bring about peace based on the vision of the two-state -- a Palestinian state with its capital of East Jerusalem that lives in peace and stability with the state of Israel based on the borders of 1967." Last week, standing next to Abbas, Trump repeated more than once, "we will get it done." Dennis Ross, President Bill Clinton’s special Middle East coordinator who has spent decades working on the conflict, said he believed the gap between the two sides has never been greater. "But we can’t afford another big initiative that will fail," he said. (WASHINGTON) -- Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Wednesday morning to discuss a dizzying array of issues amid the firestorm over President Trump’s abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey. The two top diplomats shook hands for reporters during a brief photo opp before their meeting, and as reporters began to shout questions, Tillerson waved them off and made a brief statement. “I want to welcome Foreign Minister Lavrov to the State Department and express my appreciation for him making the trip to Washington so that we can continue our dialogue and exchange of views that began in Moscow, with the dialogue he hosted, on a very broad range of topics,” he said. The two are expected to address the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria and likely the story seizing Washington right now -- Comey’s dismissal. Lavrov, however, played dumb on the topic, mocking reporters who shouted questions about Comey. Lavrov and Tillerson will meet with Trump at the White House after their meeting. Lavrov is the highest-ranking Russian official Trump has met with so far as president. The tête-à-tête is entirely closed to press, marking the sixth day in the row that the president has held no public events. Tillerson's meeting with Lavrov is the second since Tillerson has been in office. It’s also Lavrov’s first trip to Washington since August 2013, a sign of the high-stakes conversations between the two countries, even as Tillerson and others have said the relationship is at an all-time low. In reference to Tillerson's meeting, the State Department said Wednesday's agenda will include Syria, Ukraine and other bilateral issues. The White House, however, did not elaborate further on Trump's meeting with Lavrov. In particular, Tillerson and Lavrov are expected to discuss the "de-escalation zones" inside Syria that Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to create last week. Four areas in the civil war-ravaged country are supposed to be under cease-fire starting this week -- but it’s unclear how they are to be enforced or by whom, amid reports of continued fighting. The U.S. has been wary of Iran’s involvement and the past failures at a cease-fire in Syria. Trump often called for the creation of “safe zones” in Syria on the campaign trail as part of his reasoning to ban Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. Tillerson himself made a mention of "interim zones of stability" in an address to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, but has offered few details. Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee tweeted a mocking "correction" of the State Department's press release on Wednesday's meetings. In particular, there is lingering concern that Tillerson won't address the Russian hack during the 2016 election or push back against Russian interference in Ukraine or its annexation of Crimea. The meeting was originally scheduled to take place on the sidelines of the Arctic Council ministerial summit in Fairbanks, Alaska -- where the two will be joined by the ministers of the Council's six other countries to discuss scientific and environmental issues. (CANBERRA, Australia) -- An Australian senator made history Tuesday by becoming the first woman to breastfeed in the country's federal parliament. Larissa Waters, a member of the Australian Greens party, breastfed her newborn daughter, Alia, while seated at her desk on the Senate floor. "We need more women and parents in Parliament," Waters wrote on Facebook, adding that she was "so proud" to make history. "And we need more family-friendly and flexible workplaces, and affordable childcare, for everyone." Waters, who also tweeted a photo of the moment, is a senator for Queensland who took office in 2011. She lives in Brisbane with her family, according to her official biography. So proud that my daughter Alia is the first baby to be breastfed in the federal Parliament! We need more Waters last year worked to change Senate rules to give new parents the option to care for their infants on the floor of Parliament, according to the Australian Associated Press. The senator told the BBC World Service she wanted to "send a message" by caring for her daughter while on the job. "I had hoped to not only be able to feed my baby, but to send a message to young woman that they belong in the Parliament and that they can both be parliamentarians and be moms," she said in an interview that aired Wednesday. Waters described the reaction as "almost universally positive" and said she was particularly touched by the messages of support from fellow moms. "Lots of women thanking me for doing it, not just for normalizing breast feeding, which is itself an important issue because there is still a little bit of stigma in some corners of society," she told the BBC. "But it’s been lovely to hear from the young women and the other moms who have said this is a role model for my young daughter or myself to know that we can aspire to these sorts of occupations." As new frontier opens in the Arctic, Russia leaves US in its wake (NEW YORK) -- The Arctic, a mix of vast frozen tundra and expansive seas in the northernmost region of Earth, has become dramatically more complex and appealing to humans. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will join representatives from each of the eight nations with territory inside the Arctic Circle for a meeting of the Arctic Council, an organization focused on the sustainable development and environmental protection of the region. At this meeting, representatives are expected to sign a binding agreement that would increase scientific cooperation in the Arctic, according to the State Department. But the meeting belies the true race to militarize and exploit an untouched region of increased strategic importance. As sea ice declines -- largely due to global warming -- valuable waterways have emerged, making it possible to access enormous amounts of untapped natural resources. Now, Russia is leading the way to stake its claim, leaving the United States in its wake and creating new tensions between the two countries. Last week, Paul Zukunft, the commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, warned that Russia was gaining valuable influence in the Arctic by building up its military and industrial presence. “They’ve got all their chess pieces on the board right now, and right now we’ve got a pawn and maybe a rook,” he told the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). “If you look at this Arctic game of chess, they’ve got us at checkmate right at the very beginning.” In the past few years, Russia has invested heavily in building up its military presence in the Arctic, constructing new bases, refurbishing Soviet-era ones and designing communications infrastructure. Last month, ABC News was one of several foreign media outlets invited to visit the Alakurtti base, one of the refurbished bases located 250 miles from the northern port of Murmansk and on the border with Finland. While not on the Northern Sea Route, which leads from the Norwegian and Barents seas to Japan, the base is useful for training forces in Arctic conditions and houses the country’s new “Arctic Brigade.” A new Russian base on Franz Josef Land, an empty icy archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, boasts 150 personnel and air defense units. It is Russia’s northernmost installation and will officially be commissioned in the second half of 2017, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. Three more bases are in the works, in addition to an air defense shield that Russia says will cover much of its northern coast. Russian officials cite access to natural resources and shipping routes as a primary need for the country's growing military presence. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates 30 percent of the world’s untapped gas reserves (108 trillion cubic feet), 13 percent of its oil reserves (about 90 billion barrels) and $1 trillion in minerals lie in the Arctic region. But there are still challenges associated with harvesting gas and oil reserves. Equipment needs to withstand the harsh climate, and employees expect higher wages to work in such isolated conditions, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The eight nations of the Arctic -- Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States -- also have overlapping and disputed claims of sovereignty, as well as differing expectations for how environmental concerns will be taken into account when extracting natural resources. Increased transport of oil and gas also raise the possibility of a potential spill or other environmental damage. Despite these challenges, the ability to ship these resources is becoming easier as global warming opens up shipping routes. While Arctic routes don’t rival large southern routes such as the Panama Canal, they still decrease travel time for the “over-the-pole” transits. Some researchers estimate by 2030 it will take an average of just 22 days to go from North America and Europe to Japan. The Northern Sea Route saw 300 different ships conduct more than 1,700 voyages, according to the 2017 Arctic Shipping Forum. Two-thirds of those ships were Russian, and 42 percent transported raw materials such as oil and natural gas. The number of ships transiting the Northern Sea Route is only expected to grow. Zukunft pointed out the disparity between Russia and the United States in necessary hardware, such as ice breakers that open shipping lanes for commercial and military vessels. Russia has 40 of them; the U.S. has two. To make matters worse, only one of the two ice breakers is available, something Zukunft told CSIS he loses sleep over. He’s hoping Congress will fund the construction of six new ice breakers by 2023 to counter Russia’s Arctic prominence. The Department of Defense at least appears aware of its blind spots, acknowledging in a December 2016 report that U.S. forces need to enhance their capabilities in the region. The report also sends a clear warning to Russia not to overstep its boundaries in the Arctic. "In light of the Russian violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, and Russia’s efforts to intimidate its neighbors, [the Department of Defense] will continue a robust cycle of training and exercises in Europe under Operation Atlantic Resolve and will continue investments in improved posture and capabilities when needed by the combatant commanders," the report reads. It's not to say the U.S. has no military presence at all in the Arctic. Thule Air Base in Greenland, the Air Force's northernmost base, houses the 21st Space Wing and 821st Air Base Group. But if Russia's ambitions are any indication, the race for the Arctic has only just begun. (WASHINGTON) -- For the first time in years, Mr. Lavrov is coming to Washington. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov will meet in Washington Wednesday morning -- their second in-person meeting in the little over three months Tillerson has been in office. The visit by Russia’s longtime foreign minister is the first since August 2013, a sign of the high-stakes conversations between the two countries, even as Tillerson and others have said the relationship is at an all-time low. Last week, the two spoke by phone twice and their country's leaders, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, spoke once. The State Department said tomorrow's agenda will include Syria, Ukraine, and other bilateral issues. In particular, the two are expected to discuss the "de-escalation zones" inside Syria that Russia, Iran, and Turkey agreed to create last week. Four areas in the civil war-ravaged country are supposed to be under ceasefire starting this week -- but it’s unclear how they are to be enforced or by whom, amid reports of some continued fighting within them. The U.S. has expressed hesitant endorsement of the zones, wary of Iran’s involvement and the past failures at a ceasefire in Syria. Trump often called for the creation of “safe zones” in Syria on the campaign trail as part of his opposition to admitting Syrian refugees into the country. Tillerson himself made a mention of "interim zones of stability" in an address to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, but has offered few other details. Wednesday's meeting has already been criticized for what it may not include. Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee tweeted a mocking "correction" of the State Department's press release on the meeting. In particular, there is remaining concern that Tillerson won't address the Russian hack during the 2016 election or stand strongly enough against Russian interference in Ukraine or its annexation of Crimea. The meeting was originally scheduled to take place on the sidelines of the Arctic Council ministerial summit in Fairbanks, Alaska -- where the two will be joined by the ministers of the Council's six other countries to discuss scientific and environmental issues. US gave French 'heads up' about Russia's election meddling, NSA director says (WASHINGTON) -- National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers said the U.S. government gave French officials “a heads up” that they observed Russian infiltration in their presidential election systems before the interference was made public. The remark came during testimony by Rogers -– acting in his role as commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and chief of the Central Security Service -– as a witness before a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the posture of U.S. cyber-command on Tuesday. "We had become aware of Russian activity. We had talked to our French counterparts prior to the public announcements of the events that were publicly attributed this past week and [we] gave them a heads up," explained Rogers. Revealing the interaction for the first time, Rogers recalled the message from U.S. officials during their conversation notifying the French of what they’d observed: "'Look, we're watching the Russians. We're seeing them penetrate some of your infrastructure. Here's what we've seen. What can we do to try to assist?’” "We're doing similar things with our German counterparts, with our British counterparts,” he added. “They have an upcoming election sequence.” NSA Dir. Mike Rogers says US gave France "heads up" of alleged Russian cyber infiltration ahead of election: Later, Rogers said he agreed with several points made by FBI Director James Comey in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week involving Russia’s continued and possible future meddling in the U.S. political system. When asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., if Rogers concurred with Comey that Russia is still interfering in American politics, he replied, “yes.” The NSA director said also agreed that Russia has the greatest capability and intent among nation-states for future interference, and that while Democrats were targeted by Russia in 2016, they could switch aim to Republicans in the next election. “I would argue this is not about politics, this is not about party; this is about an effort against the strategic interest of every citizen of this nation,” he added. Rogers also agreed that Russia’s interference could reach beyond the presidential election to House and Senate races, and that if someone doesn’t pay a price, the Russian are going to keep meddling in American politics. 11-year-old girl dies after falling off water ride at UK theme park (STAFFORDSHIRE, England) -- An 11-year-old girl died Tuesday after falling off a water ride at a theme park in England, police said. First responders were called to Drayton Manor in Staffordshire at 2:20 p.m. local time after the girl fell into the water, according to Staffordshire Police. The girl had been pulled from the water by park staff before authorities arrived. She was airlifted to the Birmingham Children's Hospital, where she died shortly upon arrival, police said. , we can confirm that an 11-year-old girl has died this afternoon. Trained park staff were immediately on the scene after they were alerted that the 11-year-old had entered the water, said George Bryan, director of the Drayton Manor theme park. "It is with great sadness that we have to report that a young girl has passed away at Birmingham Children's Hospital following an incident on one of our rides this afternoon," Bryan said in a statement. "We are all truly shocked and devastated and our thoughts are with the her family and friends at this tremendously difficult time." , the girl was riding Splash Canyon, described on the park's as a "unpredictable" and "thrilling" river rapid ride. The ride opened in 1993. On Twitter, the park said Splash Canyon had been closed following "an incident." Splash Canyon has been closed following an incident this afternoon. Emergency services &amp; our fully trained park staff are assisting. The girl was at Drayton Manor on a school trip, the BBC reported. Her death is thought to be the first at a U.K. theme park since 2004. The United Kingdom's Health and Safety Executive has been informed of the incident. (NEW YORK) -- Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told ABC's on Tuesday that she will not question the legitimacy of the 2016 election and believes Vladimir Putin’s interference was "personal." “I think it was personal. He likes to intimidate,” Rice said of Putin's possible reasons for interfering in the U.S. election. Rice also called the Russian president “an eye-for-an-eye kind of person.” The former George W. Bush administration official also suggested that Putin may have interfered because Hillary Clinton had questioned his own 2012 electoral victory. “Now he’s saying: 'I’m going to question the legitimacy of your election by hacking into it and so forth,'" Rice said. Rice also urged Americans not to be rattled by Putin's actions. "Don’t let him get the satisfaction of thinking we don’t believe our own elections to be legitimate," she said. “What you can’t do is be intimidated by Putin or let him play these psychological games,” Rice added. “I’m not going to question the legitimacy of their vote because Vladimir Putin tried to interfere in the elections. Let’s trust our fellow citizens to have been smart enough to vote for the people they thought they ought to be voting for.” Rice also weighed in on warnings that Obama administration officials, including from the former president himself, gave Trump about his former advisor, Michael Flynn, and Flynn's ties to Russia. Flynn was later fired after his ties to Russian officials came to light. Rice said Americans should be “comforted” by Trump's choice to replace him. “H.R. McMaster is as good as you can do for national security advisor … I actually think this is a really good national security team. We have a different kind of president, alright?" Rice said. The former secretary of state also criticized Flynn’s conversations about sanctions with the Russian ambassador, which took place before President Trump was inaugurated. "As a matter of principle, you can talk to anybody in that period, but you should never suggest that you might be making policy and maybe they should just wait until there’s a change in administration. The principle is you wouldn’t do that," she said.

Sunday mornings at 8 Effort to clean up ocean plastic to begin in 12 months, years ahead of schedule (UTRECHT, Netherlands) -- A Dutch foundation dedicated to removing plastic pollution from the world’s oceans announced a new system design today that will allow them to begin an ambitious cleanup plan in the next 12 months, two years ahead of schedule. The Ocean Cleanup said Thursday its new system features an anchor that does not attach to the ocean seabed, instead floating with the ocean currents. The anchor is deep enough to keep the system moving slower than the plastic that floats on the ocean's surface. The system can then catch plastic inside its barrier. “As long as the system moves slower than the plastic, it will still collect the plastic,” said the 22-year-old head of the foundation, Boyan Slat, at a press conference accompanying the announcement today. Slat went on to say that the new design allows the system to act like “plastic magnets” traveling in the current to the places in the ocean with the highest concentrations of plastic. About 80 percent of marine debris originates as land-based trash, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Plastic debris in particular presents physical and chemical hazards to marine life because it often gets mistaken for food by birds and fish, the EPA says. “To catch the plastic, act like the plastic,” Slat said. He hopes to have multiple systems working simultaneously in different parts of the Pacific Ocean. Slat estimates that if the plan is successful, they will be able to clean up 50 percent of the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch in five years. Scientists and environmental advocates have identified several so-called patches of marine debris floating in the world's oceans, but scientists caution that the term doesn't accurately describe the scope of the problem because much of the plastic in the oceans breaks down to small parts that are not easily visible. Slat said the first element of the floating pipe is being made in California now and that the new design allows the organization to gradually scale up funding and increase financial viability. Slat, who was inspired to help clean up the ocean after a SCUBA diving trip said, “We can do this, we must do this and we will do this.” (LUXEMBOURG) -- Princess Kate was greeted by cheering fans on Thursday in Luxembourg on her second solo royal tour. Kate, 35, in a pale blue coat by designer Emilia Wickstead, attended commemorations marking the 150th anniversary of the Treaty of London, which ratified Luxembourg's independence and neutrality in Europe. She was greeted by excited young children at her first stop in Luxembourg, the Mudam Musee D'Art Moderne. Princess Stephanie of Luxembourg, a royal patron of the museum, joined Kate for a tour. Kate, who graduated with honors from St. Andrews University with a degree in art history, is patron of the National Portrait Gallery in London and an outspoken advocate of arts education for children.

Activists arrested in Moscow after demanding investigation of alleged torture of gay men (MOSCOW) -- Five LGBT activists have been arrested in Moscow as they tried to deliver a petition calling on Russian authorities to investigate the alleged detention and torture of dozens of gay men in Chechnya. One of the activists from the group LGBT Network, Nikita Safranov, spoke to ABC News from inside the police station where he and the four others were being detained. Safranov said they were arrested today while walking toward the offices of Russia’s prosecutor general, Yury Chaika, in central Moscow. The group was carrying large stacks of boxes stamped with the words “Justice for the Chechen 100” and filled with copies of the petition. Safranov said they expected to be charged with staging an unsanctioned demonstration. The group's petition, which was launched on Change.org, calls for Russia’s prosecutor to investigate recent reports that more than 100 men have been kidnapped and tortured by authorities in Chechnya as part of an alleged roundup targeting the gay community there. Reports of the alleged roundup emerged in early April after the independent newspaper, , published articles detailing accounts of how Chechen security forces were detaining the men and holding them in secret prisons. The newspaper said sources in Chechnya’s security services and the LGBT community described the detentions as a “prophylactic purge” against homosexuals in the southern Russian republic, where homosexuality is widely viewed as shameful. Since then, testimonies have emerged from some of the men detained, detailing brutal tortures. One man, who requested anonymity in an interview with ABC News last month, described how Chechen law enforcement agents had kept him in jail for a week, beat him with plastic rods and tortured him with electric shocks. Testimony from the man, whom ABC News is identifying as Z., and from other men published in s said the agents demanded that those detained name other gay men, forming a chain of terror. , told ABC News that the newspaper believes around 200 men had been detained and that it has proof that at least three men had been killed during the purge. Z., who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concerns for his safety, told ABC News he was released after the agents could find no proof he was gay. But he then fled Chechnya when a mutual acquaintance was detained, fearing authorities would return for him again. Some of the victims said police had handed them back to their families after the detentions and told them they should kill them themselves to save their honor. Chechen authorities have denied that the detentions are taking place. A spokesman for Ramzan Kadyrov, the region’s president, has said such persecutions were impossible because Chechnya does not have gay men. The regional branch of the Prosecutor’s Office in Chechnya has opened an investigation into the reports, but the denunciations from Kadyrov, who personally controls law enforcement in the region, has cast doubt that it will find anything. The Kremlin has also been reluctant to respond to the reports. President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, initially told reporters that anyone suffering abuses should report them to law enforcement. Putin himself commented publicly for the first time on the reports last week, saying he would ask federal law enforcement to investigate. The alleged detentions have prompted condemnation from around the world. The foreign ministers of Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, France and Sweden sent a joint letter last week calling on Russia to investigate. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley issued a statement in April saying the abuses “cannot be ignored.” The State Department said it was “deeply disturbed” by the reports. LGBT Network has been helping gay men to leave Chechnya. To date, it has helped 42 people escape, the organization told ABC News. Some of these men have been provided with safe-houses in Russia, but the organization is trying to get them asylum abroad in Europe or the United States. Igor Kochetkov, the group's director, said three European countries were examining the possibility of offering asylum, but no offers have been made so far. (BEIJING) -- In his first discussion with the new South Korean leader, Chinese President Xi Jinping asserted that he doesn't want South Korea to deploy a U.S. missile system, according to the BBC. The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, which would intercept attacks from North Korea, became operational in South Korea last week. A spokesperson for the liberal leader Moon Jae-in said Xi, who initiated the call, "explained the reasons for Beijing's strong and repeated opposition" to the deployment, Yonhap news agency reported. Beijing has said the system would spy on its territory. Moon, who was elected South Korean president on Tuesday, has made ambivalent comments about THAAD in the past, but during the call, both he and Xi agreed that denuclearising North Korea was a "common goal," according to the BBC. "President Moon said the THAAD issue can be resolved when there is no further provocation by North Korea," spokesman Yoon Young-chan said. Moon also raised the issue of economic retaliation against South Korean firms in China, Yoon said. The South Korean president is expected to send a delegation to Beijing to discuss both North Korea and THAAD. The THAAD deployment was agreed upon by Moon's predecessor, conservative leader Park Guen-hye. She is currently awaiting trial in prison on corruption charges. Russian firm under FBI investigation offers to help any federal investigation (WASHINGTON) -- A world-renowned software company -- the Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab -- says it wants to dispel security concerns about its products by helping any government probe of the company. "Kaspersky Lab is available to assist all concerned government organizations with any ongoing investigations, and the company ardently believes a deeper examination of Kaspersky Lab will confirm that these allegations are unfounded," the company says in a statement posted Wednesday on its website. The statement follows an ABC News report earlier this week that disclosed a long-running FBI probe of the company, and detailed growing concerns among U.S. officials that Russian spies might try to exploit Kaspersky Lab to snoop on Americans or sabotage key U.S. systems. For years, the FBI has been investigating whether Kaspersky Lab maintains any troubling relationships with the Russian government, and the U.S. agency has been trying to uncover any possible efforts to collect intelligence on Americans, sources with knowledge of the probe told ABC News. In recent months, FBI agents have taken further action to move their probe forward, including a review of records related to Kaspersky Lab, sources said. In February, the Department of Homeland Security issued a secret report on the company. And just last month, in a secret memorandum sent to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Senate Intelligence Committee raised possible red flags about Kaspersky Lab and urged the intelligence community to address potential risks posed by the firm’s powerful market position. "This [is an] important national security issue," declared the bipartisan memorandum, described to ABC News by congressional sources. Kaspersky Lab products are widely used in homes, businesses and government agencies throughout the United States, having secured contracts with the Federal Bureau of Prisons and segments of the Defense Department. Current and former U.S. officials expressed concern over Kaspersky Lab executives with previous ties to Russian intelligence and military agencies. The company’s founder and chief executive officer, Eugene Kaspersky, was trained at a coding academy sponsored by the KGB. Subsequently, current and former U.S. officials worry that Kaspersky Lab’s software could allow state-sponsored hackers to steal and manipulate users’ files, read private emails or attack critical infrastructure in the United States. "There’s absolutely knowledge amongst senior government officials that this company is potentially a threat to U.S. national security interests," according to Michael Carpenter, who until January served as the Defense Department's deputy assistant secretary for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. But in its statement Tuesday, Kaspersky Lab insisted: "As a private company, Kaspersky Lab has no ties to any government, and the company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts." "The company has a 20-year history in the IT security industry of always abiding by the highest ethical business practices, and Kaspersky Lab believes it is completely unacceptable that the company is being unjustly accused without any hard evidence to back up these false allegations," the statement said. In fact, the FBI and other agencies in the U.S. intelligence community have yet to publicly present any evidence connecting company executives with Russian security services. And sources who spoke with ABC News did not offer any evidence suggesting Kaspersky Lab has helped breach a U.S. system or taken hostile action on behalf of the Russian government. "For 20 years, Kaspersky Lab has been focused on protecting people and organizations from cyberthreats, and its headquarters' location doesn't change that mission," Kaspersky Lab said in its statement. "[J]ust as a U.S.-based cybersecurity company doesn’t allow access or send any sensitive data from its products to the U.S. government, Kaspersky Lab products also do not allow any access or provide any private data to any country's government." But, in discussing their concerns about Kaspersky Lab, current and former U.S. officials also point to Russia's System of Operative-Investigative Measures (SORM), which "legally permits authorities to monitor and record all data that traverses Russia’s networks," according to the State Department. Russian authorities must obtain a court-approved warrant to collect a customer’s information from a company. But the company doesn't always get to see the warrant, and authorities may lawfully gather information on anyone else later tied to the targeted customer "so long as the new targets are part of the same operation," according to a State Department fact sheet about SORM obtained by ABC News. "In practice, these are very broad powers," and "Russia's approach is more flexible and intrusive than similar Western systems," the State Department wrote. In an interview with ABC News, Eugene Kaspersky said, "My response if I’m asked to spy on anyone coming from any state, any government -- not only Russian -- will be definite 'no.'" According to the company, customers "have full control" over what data is shared, and they can opt out if they don’t want even anonymized data sent through servers in foreign locations like Russia, where it might be subject to collection under SORM. Also, enterprise and government users can install a local "Kaspersky security network center on their premises to make sure the data never leaves their facility or country," a spokeswoman for the company said. In its statement, the company noted that the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology has certified its encryption technologies for businesses as "fully compliant" with federal standards, which demonstrates that company products "are trusted to secure sensitive data." ABC News asked Eugene Kaspersky whether the Kremlin could force his company to target the United States. He responded, "I think it's hardly possible." Experts emphasize there is one key thing to remember about Kaspersky Lab: "They do some good things, and they have good products," said Carpenter, the former Defense Department official. Founded in 1997, the company boasts an estimated 400 million users in nearly 200 countries. And it reportedly rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, not only through its anti-virus software but also through the analysis it conducts about emerging threats. "We do not care who's behind the cybercampaigns we expose,” Eugene Kaspersky said in 2015, responding to a Bloomberg News report about his alleged ties to Russian officials. "There is cyber-evil, and we fight it." In 2013, Kaspersky Lab outed what it called Red October, an alleged Russian hacking campaign to spy on diplomatic agencies in Eastern Europe. Kaspersky Lab researchers were also behind the discovery of Stuxnet, the U.S. National Security Agency's special cyberbomb targeting Iranian nuclear facilities in 2009 and 2010. In years past, Eugene Kaspersky repeatedly met with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies across the world to share information about emerging threats and discuss "the best solutions for fighting cybercrime," according to Kaspersky Lab. However, "unfortunately we are losing our contacts with FBI ... because of the geo-political situation," Eugene Kaspersky told ABC News. “We were sharing this information, but now it's getting more and more hard to do that.” (JOHANNESBURG) – Wednesday marked the anniversary of Nelson Mandela's inauguration as South Africa's first democratically-elected president in 1994. Mandela stepped down from office in 1999 after Mandela spent his life fighting to end apartheid in South Africa. In 1962, when Mandela was leader of the African National Congress, he was captured by the South African government and tried for sabotage and treason in what has become known as the Rivonia Trial. When facing the death penalty on April 20, 1964, Mandela famously said: "I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die." Mandela was released from prison on Sunday, Feb. 11, 1990. He voted for the first time in his life on April 27, 1994, and went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. He inspired social change through his words. Some of his other famous quotes include: “It is in your hands, to make a better world for all who live in it.” "There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered."

Trump will face decades of Israeli-Palestinian talks on first trip to 'get it done' (WASHINGTON) -- It's an achievement that has proved elusive, yet continues to be a top objective for each successive American president: Middle East peace. Aaron David Miller, a veteran peace negotiator for both Republican and Democratic administrations, said about President Trump on Twitter last week, "never in decades of involvement have I heard a U.S. president more confident with less prospect." Another longtime Middle East diplomat, Robert Danin, replied to Miller on Twitter: "But have you seen one less confident with greater prospect?" Next week, Trump travels to Israel on his first overseas trip, where he is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank. "It’s something that I think is, frankly, maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years," Trump quipped during Abbas' visit to the White House last week. "Throughout my lifetime, I've always heard the toughest deal to make is the deal between Israelis and Palestinians," he said during a brief joint appearance with Abbas, "let's see if we can prove them wrong." The 82-year-old Abbas has participated in several past negotiations and signed the Oslo Accords in 1993. "With you, we now have hope," Abbas told Trump in English. And Trump told Abbas, "I want you to be the Palestinian leader to sign the final agreement with Israel." Historically, Washington’s approach has been, "We know what the final deal will look like, we just have to get the two parties there," according to Jonathan Schanzer, a research fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, D.C. The new thinking, he told reporters last week, seems to say, "We want a deal but we don't know what that final framework will look like." The Palestinians have little to lose, analysts say, and Trump has already exceeded their expectations just by extending an invitation to the White House, the first Abbas has received in three years. Netanyahu was invited before Abbas to the White House, visiting in February and holding a joint news conference with Trump. "Bibi," Trump said at the time, using the prime minister's nickname, "and I have known each other for a long time -- smart man, great negotiator." "I'm looking at two states and one state, and I like the one both parties like," Trump said at the joint news conference with Netanyahu. "I can live with either one." "Let us seize this moment together," Netanyahu said, "Let us bolster security. Let us seek new avenues of peace." During his meeting, Abbas pitched the same platform Palestinians have presented for years. "Mr. President," Abbas said, "our strategic option, our strategic choice is to bring about peace based on the vision of the two-state -- a Palestinian state with its capital of East Jerusalem that lives in peace and stability with the state of Israel based on the borders of 1967." Last week, standing next to Abbas, Trump repeated more than once, "we will get it done." Dennis Ross, President Bill Clinton’s special Middle East coordinator who has spent decades working on the conflict, said he believed the gap between the two sides has never been greater. "But we can’t afford another big initiative that will fail," he said. (WASHINGTON) -- Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Wednesday morning to discuss a dizzying array of issues amid the firestorm over President Trump’s abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey. The two top diplomats shook hands for reporters during a brief photo opp before their meeting, and as reporters began to shout questions, Tillerson waved them off and made a brief statement. “I want to welcome Foreign Minister Lavrov to the State Department and express my appreciation for him making the trip to Washington so that we can continue our dialogue and exchange of views that began in Moscow, with the dialogue he hosted, on a very broad range of topics,” he said. The two are expected to address the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria and likely the story seizing Washington right now -- Comey’s dismissal. Lavrov, however, played dumb on the topic, mocking reporters who shouted questions about Comey. Lavrov and Tillerson will meet with Trump at the White House after their meeting. Lavrov is the highest-ranking Russian official Trump has met with so far as president. The tête-à-tête is entirely closed to press, marking the sixth day in the row that the president has held no public events. Tillerson's meeting with Lavrov is the second since Tillerson has been in office. It’s also Lavrov’s first trip to Washington since August 2013, a sign of the high-stakes conversations between the two countries, even as Tillerson and others have said the relationship is at an all-time low. In reference to Tillerson's meeting, the State Department said Wednesday's agenda will include Syria, Ukraine and other bilateral issues. The White House, however, did not elaborate further on Trump's meeting with Lavrov. In particular, Tillerson and Lavrov are expected to discuss the "de-escalation zones" inside Syria that Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to create last week. Four areas in the civil war-ravaged country are supposed to be under cease-fire starting this week -- but it’s unclear how they are to be enforced or by whom, amid reports of continued fighting. The U.S. has been wary of Iran’s involvement and the past failures at a cease-fire in Syria. Trump often called for the creation of “safe zones” in Syria on the campaign trail as part of his reasoning to ban Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. Tillerson himself made a mention of "interim zones of stability" in an address to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, but has offered few details. Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee tweeted a mocking "correction" of the State Department's press release on Wednesday's meetings. In particular, there is lingering concern that Tillerson won't address the Russian hack during the 2016 election or push back against Russian interference in Ukraine or its annexation of Crimea. The meeting was originally scheduled to take place on the sidelines of the Arctic Council ministerial summit in Fairbanks, Alaska -- where the two will be joined by the ministers of the Council's six other countries to discuss scientific and environmental issues. (CANBERRA, Australia) -- An Australian senator made history Tuesday by becoming the first woman to breastfeed in the country's federal parliament. Larissa Waters, a member of the Australian Greens party, breastfed her newborn daughter, Alia, while seated at her desk on the Senate floor. "We need more women and parents in Parliament," Waters wrote on Facebook, adding that she was "so proud" to make history. "And we need more family-friendly and flexible workplaces, and affordable childcare, for everyone." Waters, who also tweeted a photo of the moment, is a senator for Queensland who took office in 2011. She lives in Brisbane with her family, according to her official biography. So proud that my daughter Alia is the first baby to be breastfed in the federal Parliament! We need more Waters last year worked to change Senate rules to give new parents the option to care for their infants on the floor of Parliament, according to the Australian Associated Press. The senator told the BBC World Service she wanted to "send a message" by caring for her daughter while on the job. "I had hoped to not only be able to feed my baby, but to send a message to young woman that they belong in the Parliament and that they can both be parliamentarians and be moms," she said in an interview that aired Wednesday. Waters described the reaction as "almost universally positive" and said she was particularly touched by the messages of support from fellow moms. "Lots of women thanking me for doing it, not just for normalizing breast feeding, which is itself an important issue because there is still a little bit of stigma in some corners of society," she told the BBC. "But it’s been lovely to hear from the young women and the other moms who have said this is a role model for my young daughter or myself to know that we can aspire to these sorts of occupations." As new frontier opens in the Arctic, Russia leaves US in its wake (NEW YORK) -- The Arctic, a mix of vast frozen tundra and expansive seas in the northernmost region of Earth, has become dramatically more complex and appealing to humans. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will join representatives from each of the eight nations with territory inside the Arctic Circle for a meeting of the Arctic Council, an organization focused on the sustainable development and environmental protection of the region. At this meeting, representatives are expected to sign a binding agreement that would increase scientific cooperation in the Arctic, according to the State Department. But the meeting belies the true race to militarize and exploit an untouched region of increased strategic importance. As sea ice declines -- largely due to global warming -- valuable waterways have emerged, making it possible to access enormous amounts of untapped natural resources. Now, Russia is leading the way to stake its claim, leaving the United States in its wake and creating new tensions between the two countries. Last week, Paul Zukunft, the commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, warned that Russia was gaining valuable influence in the Arctic by building up its military and industrial presence. “They’ve got all their chess pieces on the board right now, and right now we’ve got a pawn and maybe a rook,” he told the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). “If you look at this Arctic game of chess, they’ve got us at checkmate right at the very beginning.” In the past few years, Russia has invested heavily in building up its military presence in the Arctic, constructing new bases, refurbishing Soviet-era ones and designing communications infrastructure. Last month, ABC News was one of several foreign media outlets invited to visit the Alakurtti base, one of the refurbished bases located 250 miles from the northern port of Murmansk and on the border with Finland. While not on the Northern Sea Route, which leads from the Norwegian and Barents seas to Japan, the base is useful for training forces in Arctic conditions and houses the country’s new “Arctic Brigade.” A new Russian base on Franz Josef Land, an empty icy archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, boasts 150 personnel and air defense units. It is Russia’s northernmost installation and will officially be commissioned in the second half of 2017, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. Three more bases are in the works, in addition to an air defense shield that Russia says will cover much of its northern coast. Russian officials cite access to natural resources and shipping routes as a primary need for the country's growing military presence. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates 30 percent of the world’s untapped gas reserves (108 trillion cubic feet), 13 percent of its oil reserves (about 90 billion barrels) and $1 trillion in minerals lie in the Arctic region. But there are still challenges associated with harvesting gas and oil reserves. Equipment needs to withstand the harsh climate, and employees expect higher wages to work in such isolated conditions, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The eight nations of the Arctic -- Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States -- also have overlapping and disputed claims of sovereignty, as well as differing expectations for how environmental concerns will be taken into account when extracting natural resources. Increased transport of oil and gas also raise the possibility of a potential spill or other environmental damage. Despite these challenges, the ability to ship these resources is becoming easier as global warming opens up shipping routes. While Arctic routes don’t rival large southern routes such as the Panama Canal, they still decrease travel time for the “over-the-pole” transits. Some researchers estimate by 2030 it will take an average of just 22 days to go from North America and Europe to Japan. The Northern Sea Route saw 300 different ships conduct more than 1,700 voyages, according to the 2017 Arctic Shipping Forum. Two-thirds of those ships were Russian, and 42 percent transported raw materials such as oil and natural gas. The number of ships transiting the Northern Sea Route is only expected to grow. Zukunft pointed out the disparity between Russia and the United States in necessary hardware, such as ice breakers that open shipping lanes for commercial and military vessels. Russia has 40 of them; the U.S. has two. To make matters worse, only one of the two ice breakers is available, something Zukunft told CSIS he loses sleep over. He’s hoping Congress will fund the construction of six new ice breakers by 2023 to counter Russia’s Arctic prominence. The Department of Defense at least appears aware of its blind spots, acknowledging in a December 2016 report that U.S. forces need to enhance their capabilities in the region. The report also sends a clear warning to Russia not to overstep its boundaries in the Arctic. "In light of the Russian violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, and Russia’s efforts to intimidate its neighbors, [the Department of Defense] will continue a robust cycle of training and exercises in Europe under Operation Atlantic Resolve and will continue investments in improved posture and capabilities when needed by the combatant commanders," the report reads. It's not to say the U.S. has no military presence at all in the Arctic. Thule Air Base in Greenland, the Air Force's northernmost base, houses the 21st Space Wing and 821st Air Base Group. But if Russia's ambitions are any indication, the race for the Arctic has only just begun. (WASHINGTON) -- For the first time in years, Mr. Lavrov is coming to Washington. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov will meet in Washington Wednesday morning -- their second in-person meeting in the little over three months Tillerson has been in office. The visit by Russia’s longtime foreign minister is the first since August 2013, a sign of the high-stakes conversations between the two countries, even as Tillerson and others have said the relationship is at an all-time low. Last week, the two spoke by phone twice and their country's leaders, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, spoke once. The State Department said tomorrow's agenda will include Syria, Ukraine, and other bilateral issues. In particular, the two are expected to discuss the "de-escalation zones" inside Syria that Russia, Iran, and Turkey agreed to create last week. Four areas in the civil war-ravaged country are supposed to be under ceasefire starting this week -- but it’s unclear how they are to be enforced or by whom, amid reports of some continued fighting within them. The U.S. has expressed hesitant endorsement of the zones, wary of Iran’s involvement and the past failures at a ceasefire in Syria. Trump often called for the creation of “safe zones” in Syria on the campaign trail as part of his opposition to admitting Syrian refugees into the country. Tillerson himself made a mention of "interim zones of stability" in an address to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, but has offered few other details. Wednesday's meeting has already been criticized for what it may not include. Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee tweeted a mocking "correction" of the State Department's press release on the meeting. In particular, there is remaining concern that Tillerson won't address the Russian hack during the 2016 election or stand strongly enough against Russian interference in Ukraine or its annexation of Crimea. The meeting was originally scheduled to take place on the sidelines of the Arctic Council ministerial summit in Fairbanks, Alaska -- where the two will be joined by the ministers of the Council's six other countries to discuss scientific and environmental issues. US gave French 'heads up' about Russia's election meddling, NSA director says (WASHINGTON) -- National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers said the U.S. government gave French officials “a heads up” that they observed Russian infiltration in their presidential election systems before the interference was made public. The remark came during testimony by Rogers -– acting in his role as commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and chief of the Central Security Service -– as a witness before a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the posture of U.S. cyber-command on Tuesday. "We had become aware of Russian activity. We had talked to our French counterparts prior to the public announcements of the events that were publicly attributed this past week and [we] gave them a heads up," explained Rogers. Revealing the interaction for the first time, Rogers recalled the message from U.S. officials during their conversation notifying the French of what they’d observed: "'Look, we're watching the Russians. We're seeing them penetrate some of your infrastructure. Here's what we've seen. What can we do to try to assist?’” "We're doing similar things with our German counterparts, with our British counterparts,” he added. “They have an upcoming election sequence.” NSA Dir. Mike Rogers says US gave France "heads up" of alleged Russian cyber infiltration ahead of election: Later, Rogers said he agreed with several points made by FBI Director James Comey in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week involving Russia’s continued and possible future meddling in the U.S. political system. When asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., if Rogers concurred with Comey that Russia is still interfering in American politics, he replied, “yes.” The NSA director said also agreed that Russia has the greatest capability and intent among nation-states for future interference, and that while Democrats were targeted by Russia in 2016, they could switch aim to Republicans in the next election. “I would argue this is not about politics, this is not about party; this is about an effort against the strategic interest of every citizen of this nation,” he added. Rogers also agreed that Russia’s interference could reach beyond the presidential election to House and Senate races, and that if someone doesn’t pay a price, the Russian are going to keep meddling in American politics. 11-year-old girl dies after falling off water ride at UK theme park (STAFFORDSHIRE, England) -- An 11-year-old girl died Tuesday after falling off a water ride at a theme park in England, police said. First responders were called to Drayton Manor in Staffordshire at 2:20 p.m. local time after the girl fell into the water, according to Staffordshire Police. The girl had been pulled from the water by park staff before authorities arrived. She was airlifted to the Birmingham Children's Hospital, where she died shortly upon arrival, police said. , we can confirm that an 11-year-old girl has died this afternoon. Trained park staff were immediately on the scene after they were alerted that the 11-year-old had entered the water, said George Bryan, director of the Drayton Manor theme park. "It is with great sadness that we have to report that a young girl has passed away at Birmingham Children's Hospital following an incident on one of our rides this afternoon," Bryan said in a statement. "We are all truly shocked and devastated and our thoughts are with the her family and friends at this tremendously difficult time." , the girl was riding Splash Canyon, described on the park's as a "unpredictable" and "thrilling" river rapid ride. The ride opened in 1993. On Twitter, the park said Splash Canyon had been closed following "an incident." Splash Canyon has been closed following an incident this afternoon. Emergency services &amp; our fully trained park staff are assisting. The girl was at Drayton Manor on a school trip, the BBC reported. Her death is thought to be the first at a U.K. theme park since 2004. The United Kingdom's Health and Safety Executive has been informed of the incident. (NEW YORK) -- Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told ABC's on Tuesday that she will not question the legitimacy of the 2016 election and believes Vladimir Putin’s interference was "personal." “I think it was personal. He likes to intimidate,” Rice said of Putin's possible reasons for interfering in the U.S. election. Rice also called the Russian president “an eye-for-an-eye kind of person.” The former George W. Bush administration official also suggested that Putin may have interfered because Hillary Clinton had questioned his own 2012 electoral victory. “Now he’s saying: 'I’m going to question the legitimacy of your election by hacking into it and so forth,'" Rice said. Rice also urged Americans not to be rattled by Putin's actions. "Don’t let him get the satisfaction of thinking we don’t believe our own elections to be legitimate," she said. “What you can’t do is be intimidated by Putin or let him play these psychological games,” Rice added. “I’m not going to question the legitimacy of their vote because Vladimir Putin tried to interfere in the elections. Let’s trust our fellow citizens to have been smart enough to vote for the people they thought they ought to be voting for.” Rice also weighed in on warnings that Obama administration officials, including from the former president himself, gave Trump about his former advisor, Michael Flynn, and Flynn's ties to Russia. Flynn was later fired after his ties to Russian officials came to light. Rice said Americans should be “comforted” by Trump's choice to replace him. “H.R. McMaster is as good as you can do for national security advisor … I actually think this is a really good national security team. We have a different kind of president, alright?" Rice said. The former secretary of state also criticized Flynn’s conversations about sanctions with the Russian ambassador, which took place before President Trump was inaugurated. "As a matter of principle, you can talk to anybody in that period, but you should never suggest that you might be making policy and maybe they should just wait until there’s a change in administration. The principle is you wouldn’t do that," she said.

Having a belligerent, nuclear-armed neighbor is one hell of a campaign issue, but even by that measure, 2017 is unusual. indicted on charges of bribery and abuse of power last month As voters mull their decision, Pyongyang is believed to be prepping a sixth nuclear test, and has conducted multiple missile tests, while US President Donald Trump's unpredictable White House has talked of a Park's administration took a hardline on North Korea, but if Democratic Party frontrunner Moon Jae-in wins next Tuesday's vote, South Korea's Pyongyang policy is about to change. South Korean presidential candidate Moon Jae-in is expected to take the country in a new direction on North Korea if he wins Tuesday's election. During the campaign, Moon has pushed for a more open approach to North Korea, which would combine negotiation and economic cooperation with military and security measures. "I am confident to lead the diplomatic efforts involving multiple parties, which will lead to the complete abandonment of the North Korean nuclear program, and bring the relationship between South and North to peace, economic cooperation and mutual prosperity," he said in an April 25 debate. Policy of engagement with North Korea on economic and political issues Open communication with the North Korean regime stands in stark contrast to the previous nine years of conservative policy, which advocated a hardline approach and tough sanctions as punishment for Pyongyang's pursuance of nuclear weapons. Moon's views are seen by many as a throwback to the Sunshine Policy of the liberal governments of 1998 to 2008; no surprise, as he was a key adviser to those administrations. During the Sunshine Policy, Seoul actively engaged Pyongyang, which led to closer relations on both sides of the border and saw two South Korean Presidents visit the North Korean capital. However, the approach ultimately failed to halt North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Michael Breen, author of "The New Koreans," said Moon favors strong defense and "engagement with North Korea with realistic expectations." "That's something a lot of people can live with," he said. .m-infographic--1493892468690{ background: url(http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/html5-video-media/2017/05/04/South_Korea_presidential_infographic_medium2.png) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; height: 440px; width: 780px; } While conservatives have predictably denounced Moon, his North Korea policy doesn't seem to be turning off prospective voters. A former human rights lawyer and special forces soldier, he is leading the final round of polls by more than 18 points. Moon's main rival, the centrist software mogul Ahn Cheol-soo, has declined steadily in the polls after a series of disappointing debate performances. And while Moon has been attacked for allegedly being soft on North Korea, his popularity arises from the corruption scandal that took down Park, said Yonsei University professor John Delury. "The electorate wants to punish the whole party for the misrule of the Park era," Delury said. He said voters are still angry over the accusations of collusion between business and political interests and they see Moon as a "clean" candidate. Hong Jun-pyo, who is standing for Park's Saenuri Party -- since rebranded as Liberty Korea Party -- is polling at around 16%, according to the latest figures. While Moon's popularity may come from his stance on reform and tackling corruption, his critics have tended to focus on his stance toward Pyongyang. read a recent headline in South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, and at times during debates he has come off as defensive on the issue, repeatedly saying that negotiations exist as a tool to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. During the campaign, Moon has laid out a multi-layered approach to North Korea including expanding several defensive military programs, but also "signing a peace treaty in the Korean Peninsula after the nuclear issue has been completely resolved" and restarting economic cooperation including on tourism sites, joint industrial zones and aid. Such measures have not historically been popular with conservative administrations in the US. As a result, Moon's success may depend as much on Washington's response as Pyongyang, Delury said. He added, it's "tough to tell" how hard the Trump administration would work to block any new initiative from Seoul. The two countries have a decades-long military and political alliance dating back to the Korean War. More than 29,000 US troops are stationed in South Korea, and both countries are While Republican US administrations have typically taken a hard line on North Korean issues regardless of their counterparts in Seoul, this week Trump injected more when he said he would be "honored" to meet leader Kim Jong Un under the "right circumstances." Moon has played up Trump's apparent willingness to sit down with Kim, telling the Washington Post that he is on the "same page" as the US leader on the issue. "I believe President Trump is more reasonable than he is generally perceived. President Trump uses strong rhetoric towards North Korea but, during the election campaign, he also said he could talk over a burger with Kim Jong Un," Moon told the newspaper. However, one area where they are definitely not in agreement is over the deployment in South Korea of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system. , at least partially. Moon has opposed the THAAD deployment and called for the matter to be decided by the next South Korean government following public consultation and a vote in the National Assembly. Breen said the deployment is likely now a done deal, but the process has upset some in Seoul. "It's touching a nerve here, which everyone can relate to, the US disrespecting South Korean sovereignty," he said. Euan Graham, a Korea expert at Australia's Lowy Institute, said the THAAD deployment and Trump's rhetoric about Korean issues risks "inflaming a sense that (the country) is being bypassed on its own national security concerns." Fears that the US could "go it alone" on North Korea -- to use Trump's own words -- have cast a shadow over the election. Moon said in an April 13 debate that if something like another North Korean nuclear test happens and the US plans a military response, his first call isn't to Pyongyang, but to Washington, to tell Trump not to strike without South Korean agreement.

Sam Hunt returns to Vegas to sing "Body Like a Back Road" on the BBMAs Pups &amp; projects: Brett Eldredge celebrates Edgar and unveils new songs "I called it!": Lauren Alaina says she always knew "American Idol" would be back (BEIJING) — In his first discussion with the new South Korean leader, Chinese President Xi Jinping asserted that he doesn’t want South Korea to deploy a U.S. missile system, according to the BBC. The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, which would intercept attacks from North Korea, became operational in South Korea last week. A spokesperson for the liberal leader Moon Jae-in said Xi, who initiated the call, “explained the reasons for Beijing’s strong and repeated opposition” to the deployment, Yonhap news agency reported. Beijing has said the system would spy on its territory. Moon, who was elected South Korean president on Tuesday, has made ambivalent comments about THAAD in the past, but during the call, both he and Xi agreed that denuclearising North Korea was a “common goal,” according to the BBC. “President Moon said the THAAD issue can be resolved when there is no further provocation by North Korea,” spokesman Yoon Young-chan said. Moon also raised the issue of economic retaliation against South Korean firms in China, Yoon said. The South Korean president is expected to send a delegation to Beijing to discuss both North Korea and THAAD. The THAAD deployment was agreed upon by Moon’s predecessor, conservative leader Park Guen-hye.
