Κορέα (pics) Τι αλλάζει στις πτήσεις για τα tablets και τα laptops μετά την απόφαση των ΗΠΑ Οι Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες και η Νότια Κορέα έχουν συμφωνήσει στην ανάπτυξη του συστήματος thaad ως απάντηση στις εκτοξεύσεις πυραύλων της , ενώ η Κίνα αντιτίθεται στο βήμα αυτό λέγοντας ότι δεν θα αποτελέσει ιδιαίτερα αποτρεπτική κίνηση, ενώ θα αποσταθεροποιήσει την ασφάλεια της περιοχής. επισκέφτηκε την Τρίτη λιμάνι της Νότιας Κορέας, στο πλαίσιο υλοποίησης τακτικής επίδειξης αμυντικής ισχύος και ενώ κλιμακώνονται οι ανησυχίες για το ενδεχόμενο μιας νέας πυραυλικής ή πυρηνικής δοκιμής από τη Βόρεια Κορέα. Το κρατικό πρακτορείο ειδήσεων της Νότιας Κορέας γνωστοποίησε την Τρίτη τη πυροβολικού στην ανατολική ακτή της Βόρειας Κορέας, χωρίς ωστόσο να υπάρξει άμεση επιβεβαίωση από το υπουργείο Άμυνας στη Σεούλ. Το νοτιοκορεατικό πρακτορείο επικαλείται πηγή της νοτιοκορεατικής κυβέρνησης, η οποία δήλωσε ότι υπάρχουν ενδείξεις για , αλλά και για τη διεξαγωγή ασκήσεων με πραγματικά πυρά, γύρω από την Γονσάν που βρίσκεται στην ανατολική ακτή της χώρας. ανακοινώθηκε από τις αμερικανικές στρατιωτικές δυνάμεις που σταθμεύουν στο έδαφος της Νότιας Κορέας και καθώς πραγματοποιούσαν συνάντηση οι εκπρόσωποι της Νότιας Κορέας, της Ιαπωνίας και των ΗΠΑ, αναφορικά με την αντιμετώπιση της απειλής από την κλιμάκωση της έντασης με τη Βόρεια Κορέα, μεταδίδει το αθηναϊκό πρακτορείο. Από την συνάντηση αυτή των απεσταλμένων των τριών χωρών για την με την Πιονγιάνγκ, που έγινε στο Τόκιο, γνωστοποιήθηκε ότι αναζητήθηκαν τρόποι για την ουσιαστική συνεργασία της Ρωσίας και της Κίνας, προκειμένου να αντιμετωπιστεί η σημερινή δυσάρεστη κατάσταση με το επίκεντρο του ενδιαφέροντος στην αποφυγή χρήσης στρατιωτικών μέσων. Τόσο η Νότια Κορέα, όσο και η Ιαπωνία τάσσονται υπέρ της ειρηνικής εκτόνωσης της κρίσης, καθώς θα κληθούν ν' αντιμετωπίσουν άμεσα τις σοβαρές συνέπειες ενός προληπτικού πυρηνικού πλήγματος των ΗΠΑ κατά της Βόρειας Κορέας. , αλλά και πυραύλους τύπου “κρουζ”, που μπορούν να πλήξουν χερσαίους στόχους. Ωστόσο, παρά το πολεμικό κλίμα που διαμορφώνεται, ο Αμερικανός πρόεδρος Ντόναλντ Τραμπ ζήτησε από τον ΟΗΕ την επιβολή σκληρότερων κυρώσεων κατά της Πιονγιάνγκ, χαρακτηρίζοντας τη Βόρεια Κορέα “παγκόσμια απειλή” και “ένα πρόβλημα που πρέπει τελικά να επιλύσουμε.” Παράλληλα, αναφέρθηκε και στο καθεστώς της Βόρειας Κορέας, το οποίο χαρακτήρισε “απαράδεκτο.” Οι δηλώσεις του έγιναν στη διάρκεια συνάντησης του με τους πρεσβευτές των 15 κρατών-μελών του Συμβουλίου Ασφαλείας με τη που πραγματοποιήθηκε στο Λευκό Οίκο. “Το Συμβούλιο Ασφαλείας θα πρέπει να είναι προετοιμασμένο για την επιβολή επιπρόσθετων και πιο αυστηρών κυρώσεων κατά της Βόρειας Κορέας, για το πυρηνικό και πυραυλικό της πρόγραμμα,” τόνισε ο Τραμπ. εκφράζουν φόβους ότι η έκτη πυρηνική δομική της Βόρειας Κορέας έχει δρομολογηθεί , ενώ η πραγματοποίησή της είναι απλά θέμα χρόνου. Ο προβληματισμός εντείνεται, ενώ θεωρείται πιθανή και η πραγματοποίηση μιας νέας δοκιμαστικής πυραυλικής εκτόξευσης. Από την πλευρά της, η επίσημη εφημερίδα “china daily” ανέφερε σε σημερινό δημοσίευμά της ότι τόσο η Πιονγιάνγκ, όσο και η Ουάσιγκτον θα πρέπει να κάνουν ένα βήμα πίσω εγκαταλείποντας την επιθετική ρητορική τους, ώστε η κρίση να επιλυθεί με πολιτικά μέσα. “Με δεδομένη τη ρητορική και τις πράξεις τους, οι αξιωματούχοι στην Πιονγιάνγκ έχουν παρερμηνεύσει τις που στοχεύουν στο πυρηνικό και το πυραυλικό της πρόγραμμα κι όχι το πολιτικό σύστημά της, αλλά και την ηγεσία της. Έτσι, έχουν υπερεκτιμήσει τις δυνατότητές τους, αλλά και τους κινδύνους που προκαλούνται” για τη σταθερότητα της περιοχής, τόνισε η εφημερίδα που είναι επίσημο όργανο του Κινεζικού Κομμουνιστικού Κόμματος. Ο τόνος του σχολίου της εφημερίδας συμβαδίζει απόλυτα με την άποψη του Κινέζου προέδρου Σι Τζινπίνγκ στην τηλεφωνική επικοινωνία που είχε χθες με τον Αμερικανό πρόεδρο Ντόναλντ Τραμπ συνιστώντας αυτοσυγκράτηση σε όλες τις πλευρές, παρά την άσκηση πιέσεων από την Ουάσιγκτον για την , ώστε ν' ασκηθούν πιέσεις αποκλιμάκωσης της έντασης στη Βόρεια Κορέα. Από την άλλη μεριά, η Κίνα αποτελεί τον πιο στενό σύμμαχο της Βόρειας Κορέας, ενώ οι κινήσεις της Πιονγιάνγκ, έχουν προκαλέσει εκνευρισμό στο Πεκίνο μέσω της επιμονής της για την ανάπτυξη του πυραυλικού και του πυρηνικού της προγράμματος.

Ο αμερικανικός ναυτικός σχηματισμός πραγματοποίησε χθες ασκήσεις σε θαλάσσια περιοχή του Ειρηνικού με τη συμμετοχή δύο ιαπωνικών αντιτορπιλικών, προκαλώντας την αντίδραση της Βόρειας Κορέας που ανακοίνωσε: “Πρόκειται για μια επικίνδυνη ενέργεια από αυτούς που σχεδιάζουν έναν πυρηνικό πόλεμο εισβολής. Οι ΗΠΑ θα πρέπει να διατηρήσουν την ψυχραιμία τους και να σκεφτούν τις οποιασδήποτε καταστροφικές συνέπειες που μπορεί να προκαλέσει μία απερίσκεπτη και στρατιωτικά προβοκατόρικη ενέργεια,” ανέφερε σε σχόλιο της η εφημερίδα “rodong sinmun” που ελέγχεται από το Εργατικό Κόμμα της Βόρειας Κορέας.
